Crassula fascicularis,Crassula fascicularis,"Tuberose. Crassula fascicularis is widespread and variable in the wild, in terms of the size of the leaves, number of flowers and flower colour, and this is the cause of some of its many synonyms. It is found in the older literature under some of them, in particular Crassula odoratissima Andrews and Rochea odoratissima (Andrews) Link. The name odoratissima means ‘most scented’, from the Latin odoro meaning ‘to smell’ or ‘give off a fragrance’ and issima is the superlative. The name Rochea, the old name for some crassulas and which was sunk into synonymy under Crassula by Toelken in 1985, honours the Swiss botanical author Francois de la Roche, who died in 1813.

Crassula fascicularis was described by Lamarck in 1786. It was first illustrated in volume 1 of The Botanists’s Repository by Henry Charles Andrews, under the name Crassula odoratissima Andrews or sweet-scented crassula. The plant illustrated was raised in the nursery of Messrs. Lee and Kennedy in Hammersmith in about 1794, although it did not flower until 1796. They describe the scent of this plant to be so powerful at night that some may deem it almost offensive, but others consider it most agreeable and similar to that of the tuberose (Polianthes tuberosa).

The flowers are fragrant from about midday and their strong sweet smell becomes even more potent during the afternoon and into the evening, reaching a peak around midnight. The nectar is secreted in the afternoon until midnight, while the moths are active. The volume of nectar and the intensity of the fragrance are at their peak just before midnight.","Crassula fascicularis is an erect, succulent shrublet, 150–400 mm high, branching from a slightly woody base. It has sessile (stalkless), narrow lance-shaped, upward-pointing, scarcely fleshy leaves, 20–40 mm long and 2–3 mm broad, on stems that are frequently reddish. They usually have tiny curved hairs along the margins, which give the leaves a silvery edge.

Crassula fascicularis grows in fynbos on dry sandstone slopes, at 50 to 1 200 m altitude in the mountains of the Western Cape, from Gifberg near Vanrhynsdorp to the Langeberg Mountains near Bredasdorp, including the Cape Peninsula.

The genus Crassula is one of the most diverse succulent genera, varying from tiny moss-like annual plants and small rosettes a few millimetres tall, to 2 m tall succulent ‘trees’ like Crassula ovata. There are more than 300 Crassula species of which approximately 150 are found in southern Africa where they are widespread but concentrated in the semi-arid winter-rainfall areas. The centre of distribution of this genus is in southern Africa, but they extend beyond Africa into Europe, America, Australia, New Zealand and the southern islands.","The name Crassula is the diminutive of the Latin crassus which means ‘thick’ or ‘fat’, referring to the fleshy nature of the genus as a whole. The name fascicularis means ‘clustered’ or ‘bundled’, from the Latin fasciculus meaning ‘a little bundle’ or ‘packet’, or ‘a bunch of flowers’, and referring to the clustered flowers.

Although Crassula fascicularis was introduced into horticulture in England in about 1794, it is not widely grown or very well known as a garden plant or pot plant. Crassula fascicularis is not used in traditional medicine.


","In spring and early summer (September–November), it has attractive, rounded to flat-topped clusters of cream-coloured to pale yellowish green or rarely white flowers. Each flower is 20–32 mm long, tubular, with lobes curled back, and often flushed with reddish pink. The flowers have no stalk. The base of the floral tube is enclosed in a green or red or red-streaked calyx, which is fringed with tiny white hairs. 
","Crassulas have an extraordinary metabolism that allows them to photosynthesise normally without losing much water through their leaves, known as Crassulacean Acid Metabolism or CAM. This gives them the ability to survive and thrive in dry regions or those that experience recurring droughts. All plants need CO2 (carbon dioxide) for photosynthesis. Most plants take in CO2 during daylight hours through their stomata (pores in the leaves) and cannot avoid losing water at the same time through these open pores. In Crassula the stomata are closed during the day, but open at night, so that when they take in the CO2, they lose the least amount of water. The CO2 taken in at night is stored in the form of organic crassulacean acids. During the day, these acids are broken down and the CO2 is released and re-used in the photosynthetic process. In this way they lose much less water, yet can photosynthesise normally during the daylight hours. Furthermore, during extremely dry periods they won't even open their stomata at night, and will re-cycle the CO2 within the cells. They would not be able to grow at all, but the cells will be kept healthy – this is known as CAM-idling.

Most crassulas have hydathodes on the leaves. In Crassula fascicularis they are in a dense row along the upper and lower leaf margins, but they are very small and usually hardly visible. Hydathodes are special water-secreting structures on the surface of a leaf, similar to stomata, but larger. They are mostly found on aquatic plants where their function is to get rid of excess water in the plant. In Crassula, which are adapted to arid environments, the hydathodes have a different function, they are able to take up liquid water on the leaves. This enables them to survive in arid regions where rainfall is infrequent but the plants often get wet from dew or fog.","Crassula fascicularis is not quite as tough, adaptable and easy to grow as some other crassulas. Grow it in a sunny position in well-drained, sandy soil with an acidic to neutral pH. Feed with well-rotted compost applied as a mulch, or frequent low doses of fertiliser. Take care not to overwater. Try this elegant little succulent in a sunny rockery or terrace wall, the fynbos garden, or water-wise garden. It is easy to grow in containers and can also be grown indoors on a sunny windowsill, or where it gets bright light. The spring flowers are most strongly fragrant in the evening, so plant one where you are likely to smell it in the evenings, or take the pots indoors or onto the patio in the evenings, while they are in flower. They don’t need much care once they are established, but in a garden situation, make sure that they are not overgrown or crowded out by neighbouring plants. It is not suited to very cold climates although it is probably frost hardy to USDA Zone 9, -1 to -7ºC.

Propagate Crassula fascicularis by seeds or cuttings. Sow seeds in autumn, or spring in summer-rainfall climates. Use a well-drained sandy, sterile medium. The seeds are small and can be mixed with fine sand and sprinkled over the surface. Keep moist and warm, but shaded and well ventilated.

Crassula fascicularis is easy to root. Remove a side shoot, gently remove or cut off the leaves from the lower third of the stem and place in a sandy, well-drained soil mix in a semi-shaded position and keep moist but not wet. Cuttings can be taken at any time of the year and there is no need for rooting hormone, bottom heat or misting.

","Crassula fascicularis has pale coloured, evening-scented flowers, with long narrow corolla tubes, with the anthers inside the tubes, all of which indicate that it is pollinated by moths. This was confirmed by the 1993 study by Johnson et al., where no insect visitors were observed during the day, but light trapping at night caught a number of Geometrid moths with Crassula fascicularis pollen on their probosces. Thus Crassula fascicularis attracts and is pollinated by Geometrid moths. ",#Fragrant,"Crassula fascicularis is not used in traditional medicine.
","According to the Red List of South African plants checked on 23 September 2015, the conservation status of this plant is Least Concern (LC). This species is not threatened and its wild population is stable.",,,,
Hyacinthaceae,Hyacinthaceae,"Hyacinths (sweet and green, though different colors exude slightly different smells.) ","The flowers are mostly radially symmetrical with six tepals (petals) arranged in two whorls of three each. These may be similar to one another, or the inner three may differ slightly from the outer three, often just in shape but sometimes also in size and markings. In a very few species of Daubenya the lower flowers in the raceme are more or less two-lipped and thus bilaterally (not radially) symmetrical. The flowers vary in colour from dull greenish or grey, through white, to blue, yellow, orange or red. In several speciesof Lachenalia they are multicoloured, often with dark tips on the outer three tepals. In some species the flowers are very fragrant. The petals are either separate or joined at the bottom into a short or long tube. The flowers of most species last several days but are much shorter-lived in all species of Drimia, where they last just a few hours or a single day at most. The six stamens are inserted at the base of the petals or just within the tube (if present). The ovary is superior with three locules each containing several to many ovules attached to the centre. Each flower has a single style.

The plants are deciduous or rarely evergreen perennials with a bulb, which can sometimes be quite large. The leaves are usually lance-shaped and soft-textured, with rather slimy sap. The leaves are mostly held upright but in several species from the South African winter rainfall area they lie flat against the ground. Mostly the leaves are smooth and unmarked but in most species of Ledebouria (also some Lachenalia and Eucomis from South Africa) the leaves are attractively spotted or streaked with purple or dark green. Occasionally the leaves may have their upper surface covered with warts or pustules, or coarse hairs, especially in species of Lachenalia and Massonia. In some species the leaves are narrow and needle-like or cylindrical. The flower stalk is leafless and the flowers are always arranged in racemes. Sometimes these may be very short so that the flowers are crowded into a head-like cluster. In the genera Bowiea and Igidiae the raceme is highly branched and sprawls through the surrounding vegetation. Each flower arises in the axil of a bract, which may be large and leaf-like or minute and vestigial. In the subfamily Urgineoideae the lower bracts have a flattened spur at their base. In some genera a second smaller bract arises on the base of the flower stalk, or pedicel, as well.

The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open along three sides to release the seeds. These are very variable in shape. In most genera they are tetrahedral or variously angled and without obvious adaptations for dispersal. Flattened seeds with wing-like edges that are adapted to wind dispersal characterise the subfamily Urgineoideae, whereas glossy, globose or pear-shaped seeds characterise the subfamily Hyacinthoideae. No species have fleshy seeds.

The species grow in all sorts of soils, derived from granite, basalt, dolerite, clay, limestone and sandstone. Most species favour loamy or clay soils, often among rocks where drainage is good, but some grow in marshes and others in pure sand. Species grow from the coast to the top of the interior escarpment at over 3 000 m. Relatively few species are very localised in occurrence, but the species ofDaubenya is a notable exception.

Throughout Africa and the Mediterranean and near-East into India, with a few species in western South America. The family is mostly found in seasonal climates with a pronounced dry season and is rare in tropical lowlands and forested areas. It is best represented in southern Africa, particularly in the winter rainfall parts, with a second centre of diversity in the Mediterranean basin. Somewhere between 700-900 species are known world-wide, just over half of them in southern Africa. Almost 200 species alone are known from the Cape Floral Region. Different botanists have very different opinions about the boundaries of the genera. The number of genera recognised from sub-Saharan Africa by different botanists ranges from around 40 at the one extreme to 15 at the other. The motivation for these changes has been to reflect accurately the evolutionary relationships of the species. In the past, genera were often defined on the appearance of the flowers. With hindsight it seems that in many cases these differences merely reflected different pollination strategies between groups of species, and not more fundamental differences in the their evolutionary history.

The family is best represented in open, seasonal habitats. The richest areas for species in southern Africa are the succulent karoo and fynbos of the Northern and Western Cape, with most species ofLedebouria and Eucomis found in the montane grasslands of eastern South Africa, Swaziland and Lesotho. Fewer species occur in savanna, semi-arid central karroo and forest","The family name is based on the genus Hyacinthus, which actually comprise just two or three species from the middle East. The genus Hyacinthus dates from 1753, when it was coined by Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus. Its name derives from the Greek myth in which a beautiful flower, variously described as dark red or purple, sprung from the blood of the handsome youth Hyacinthus, the beloved of Apollo, and accidentally struck down by the god. Several different plants have been identified with the myth but it is most likely that it originally referred to Gladiolus italicus, whose lower petals bear graphic markings that could be construed to represent the Greek letters AI that were supposed to have been inscribed on the mythological flower.","Class: Angiospermae (monocotyledons) Order: Asparagales

The circumscription of the genera and the relationships between them have long been contentious. Recent DNA analyses have provided the first firm foundation for subdividing the family, and it is now accepted that there are four subfamilies:

Members of Hyacinthaceae occur in a great variety of habitats. About the only place they do not grow is in the sea itself, although several species of Lachenalia and Ornithogalum grow in coastal sands within reach of the spray. Most species are adapted to seasonal climates that have a pronounced dry or cold period unfavourable for plant growth, and during which the plants are dormant. As a result, most species are deciduous. Evergreen species are restricted to subtropical forests or savannah, temperate grasslands, and perennially moist fynbos. A few species grow in marshes or along streams, and some even grow only in the spray of seasonal waterfalls.

The above-ground parts (leaves and stems) of deciduous species die down when the bulb or corm enters dormancy. The plants thus survive periods that are unfavourable for growth by retreating underground. This is particularly useful in grasslands and fynbos, which are adapted to regular burning in the dry season. At this time the plants are dormant and their bulbs or corms are able to survive the heat of the fires underground. Veld fires clear the soil surface of competing vegetation, as well as fertilise it with ash. With the arrival ofthe first rains, the dormant corms are ready to burst into growth, sending up flowers and stems before they can be shaded out by other vegetation. Many species of Drimia delay their flowering until the dry season, at which time the leaves are withered and are often blown away.

The family has a relatively diverse pollination ecology, especially in winter rainfall regions of southern Africa. Most species are pollinated by various species of solitary bees but some, like the genus Veltheimia, and a few species of Lachenalia and Daubenya, are adapted to pollination by sunbirds. These species typically have red to orange, trumpet-like flowers that secrete large amounts of nectar. The group of species previously placed in Dipcadi (now included by some in Ornithogalum) are adapted to pollination by moths, and secrete a rather strong fragrance at night. The brightly coloured species of Ornithogalum, such as O. dubium and Daubenya aurea, are pollinated by monkey-beetles, while some species of Massonia are visited by rodents.
","3,7-dymethyl-1,3(E), 5(E)-octatriene-7-ol; (E)-cinnamic alcohol and ethyl 2-methoxy benzoate","Several genera are important in horticulture, both as cut flowers and as garden plants. The most important cut flowers are Ornithogalum thyrsoides and O. conicum, known affectionately as chinkerinchees for the squeaking sound that their stems produce when rubbed gently together. These long-lasting flowers were shipped to Britian in large numbers from South Africa during the Victorian period. Among the garden plants the genera Hyacinthus, Hyacinthoides and Muscari are the most important Mediterranean ones, while among the South African genera, Ornithogalum (Galtonia), Veltheimia and Eucomis are widely cultivated. The evergreen Drimiopsis (previously known as Drimiopsis maculata but now included in the genus Ledebouria as L. petiolata) is a very popular house-plant, producing attractive arrow-shaped leaves marked with dark green spots.

In the Garden, species of Hyacinthaceae are generally easy to cultivate and flower regularly as long as their need for a resting season is taken into account. Otherwise the bulbs are prone to rotting. Generally speaking, species from the east coast, which has a less seasonal climate, are easiest in gardens. This includesVeltheimia bracteata and species of Eucomis. Species from the summer rainfall areas require a dry winter resting period, whereas those from the winter rainfall region require a cool, moist winter growing season and a dry summer.",,#Fragrant,,"Species of Orntihogalum are among the most poisonous plants in South Africa and may lead to stock losses if contaminated fodder is eaten. Species of Drimia and Bowiea are also highly toxic, but are used in small doses in traditional medicine to treat various illnesses. Overdosage can be fatal.",,,,
Clivia,Clivia miniata var. citrina,"
Citrusy and earthy.","This evergreen perennial reaches up to 0.8 m high in flower. It is generally classed as a bulbous plant and grows from a vertical, subterranean rhizome which sometimes extends above ground, with a thick mat of horizontally spreading, fleshy roots. The strap-shaped, arching leaves are light to deep green, arranged in 2 opposite rows (distichous) and sheathing at the base, forming a short pseudostem. The peduncle is laterally flattened with 2 sharp margins and emerges adjacent to the youngest leaves, towards the centre of the plant. The inflorescence is a 16–30-flowered umbel of moderately or widely funnel-shaped, cream-coloured or light to bright lemon-yellow flowers, sometimes with green-flushed throats. The flowers have short perianth tubes 7–10 mm long, broadly lance-shaped outer tepals, up to 60 mm long and spoon-shaped inner tepals, up to 65 mm long. The 6 stamens are slightly or strongly curved downwards and the ripe anthers have bright yellow pollen. The round or oblong ovary has a straight or slightly downwardly curved style, with 3 short, sticky stigmatic branches.

The ripe fruit is a round or egg-shaped, bright yellow or sometimes red-speckled berry containing 1, several or many, irregularly shaped, hard, light brown seeds, embedded in yellowish pulp. The basic chromosome number is x = 11.","The earliest record of a yellow form of C. miniata from a known wild source, is that made in 1888 in a forest near Eshowe, in eastern KwaZulu-Natal. The resident commissioner of Zululand, Sir Melmoth Osborn, noticed it among firewood that had been collected by one of his staff, and he propagated it. Two plants were later obtained by his deputy, Sir Charles Saunders, who in turn sent one specimen to his artist mother Katharine Saunders some distance to the south, in Tongaat. Her painting, done from a somewhat bedraggled flower head that had spent several days in a post bag en route via ox-cart to Tongaat in October 1893, was eventually published in the book Flower paintings of Katharine Saunders, in 1979. A plant from this collection was sent to Kew and successfully grown there, and later described as C. miniata var. flava (a synonym of C. miniata var. citrina) by E.P. Phillips in 1931, in The Flowering Plants of South Africa, with a colour plate by Cythna Letty.

In 1897, a yellow-flowered plant collected at an unspecified locality in Zululand by Captain Mansell, flowered in cultivation in the garden of Mrs Powys Rogers in Cornwall, England. Two years later, another yellow-flowered specimen, earlier sent to Kew by the Rev. W.H. Bowden of North Devon from a different source in Zululand, flowered at Kew, and was noted in The Gardener’s Chronicle as C. miniata var. citrina, in 1899 by William Watson, then Assistant Curator of the gardens at Kew. Later that year he followed this with a detailed description in the journal The Garden, illustrated with a colour plate by the English botanical painter Henry Moon of the plant grown in Cornwall. Due to their rarity in cultivation, yellow forms have commanded high prices and long been regarded as family heirlooms, but are becoming more widely cultivated.

Numerous additional collections of C. miniata var. citrina have since been made in the wild, or arisen in cultivation (both in South Africa and abroad), and some of the more striking ones have received cultivar names. They are distinguished by various features, including flower head shape and size, flower orientation, flower shape, size and colour, presence or absence of a green throat, tepal shape and degree of overlapping, leaf width and colour, flowering period, and tendency to form suckers or not. In addition, certain cultivars are scented, such as ‘Kirstenbosch Yellow’ which has a sweet, azalea-like fragrance.","Clivia miniata var. citrina is known from northeastern Mpumalanga, northern Swaziland, northern, central, eastern and southern KwaZulu-Natal and the eastern part of the Eastern Cape. It occurs as sporadic individuals within populations of mainly orange or red-flowered specimens (var. miniata), never as populations of exclusively yellow-flowered plants. Its habitat is coastal and inland afromontane forest, in ravines, along shaded watercourses and on rock ledges on south-, southeast- or rarely west-facing slopes, in decomposed leaf litter, between sandstone boulders and on dolerite soils, from close to sea level to 1 500 m altitude. This variety is suited to cultivation in dappled shade in frost-free environments.

The genus Clivia honours Lady Charlotte Florentia Clive, Duchess of Northumberland, in whose conservatory the first described member of the genus, C. nobilis, flowered in the late 1820s at Syon House, along the Thames, near Kew. The specific name miniata is descriptive of the flame-scarlet tepal colour of the typical colour forms (var. miniata), and the varietal name citrina describes the lemon-yellow tepal colour of certain forms of this variety.

Clivia miniata var. citrina is an evergreen perennial adapted to warm, moist summers and cool, dry winters. The new leaves emerge in the centre of the plant in spring and early summer, adjacent to the flower head. The berries reach maturity within 9–12 months, by which time the outer fleshy covering has turned light to bright yellow. They remain on the plant for months after maturity, the outer layer eventually disintegrating and the seeds falling to the ground. Flowering takes place from August to November, with a peak in September and October, but sporadic blooms may appear at any time of year. The flowers of certain forms are partially self-fertile in cultivation, sometimes producing a few seeds per flower head, irrespective of visits by potential pollinators. Swallowtail butterflies consume the nectar of the reddish orange flowers of var. miniata in the wild and are their main pollinators, however, it is not known whether they also visit those of var. citrina. Honeybees have occasionally been seen to feed on the nectar and pollen of var. citrina in cultivation at Kirstenbosch National Botanical Garden.","The yellow forms fall into two main classes; those that breed true to type when self-pollinated (selfed) are classed as ‘Group 1’ and those that do not, are classed as ‘Group 2’. Members of ‘Group 1’ have no trace of anthocyanin pigment in their flowers and fruits, and they breed true to type (such as ‘Kirstenbosch Yellow’) when selfed or crossed with other forms belonging to ‘Group 1’. Those belonging to ‘Group 2 ’, have minute traces of anthocyanin (pinkish-red) pigment streaks or spots in their flowers and fruits (such as ‘Natal Yellow’).

When a member belonging to ‘Group 2’ is crossed with another member of ‘Group 2’, the progeny is usually 100% yellow, such as the cross raised by the author, known as Pat’s Gold strain (‘Butter Yellow’ x ‘Natal Yellow’).

When a ‘Group 1’ plant is crossed with a ‘Group 2’ plant, the progeny is usually 100% orange, such as the cross raised by the author known as C. miniata Kirstenbosch Supreme strain (‘Kirstenbosch Yellow’ x ‘Natal Yellow’). When self-pollinated, the progeny of yellows belonging to ‘Group 2’ usually varies from 100% orange to 50% yellow, or a very low percentage of yellow, for example ‘Dwesa Yellow’ produces only a few yellows when selfed.

Yellow forms from known wild sources are recorded mainly from KwaZulu-Natal, including the following forms which have cultivar names (with ‘Group’ membership indicated, where known): ‘Blinkwater Yellow’ (Group 1), ‘Eshowe Yellow’ (Group 1), ‘Mare’s Yellow’ (Group 1), ‘Mvuma Yellow’, ‘Natal Yellow’ (Group 2), ‘Ndwedwe Alpha Thurston’ (Group 2), ‘Ndwedwe Beta Thurston’, ‘Oribi Gorge Yellow’ (Group 2) and ‘Whyte Yellow’ (Group 1). ‘Dwesa Yellow’ (Group 2) and ‘Kentani Yellow’ (Group 2) are from the Eastern Cape. Those originating from cultivated sources in South Africa, include ‘Butter Yellow’ (Group 2), ‘De Villiers Yellow’, ‘Kirstenbosch Yellow’ (Group 1), ‘Noyce’s Sunburst’ (Group 1), ‘Noyce’s Yellow’, ‘Watkins Golden Glow’ and ‘Watkins Yellow’.

","Comprising 5 species [C. caulescens, C. gardenii (including C. robusta), C. miniata, C. mirabilis and C. nobilis], Clivia is endemic to South Africa and Swaziland. C. miniata has the widest distribution, occurring from northeastern Mpumalanga and northern Swaziland to the Eastern Cape, with a disjunct population in the southern Cape. Peach-flowered forms of this species belong to var. miniata. In parts of its range, C. miniata overlaps with the 3 tubular-flowered species from the summer rainfall area, C. caulescens, C. gardenii and C. nobilis. C. mirabilis, the only species from an exclusively winter rainfall area, is endemic to the Bokkeveld escarpment and to mountains near Vanrhynsdorp. Within the family Amaryllidaceae, Clivia falls within the tribe Haemantheae, whose members all produce fleshy berries, including Apodolirion, Cryptostephanus, Gethyllis, Haemanthus and Scadoxus. Clivia is most closely related to Cryptostephanus, a genus of 3 species mainly from East and southcentral Africa with somewhat similar roots, leaves, flower stems and fleshy berries, but whose flowers differ markedly in their smaller size and colour (white, brownish or purplish maroon) and in having a partially hidden, crown-like structure of narrow appendages. Cryptostephanus also differs in basic chromosome number (x = 12).

Clivia miniata var. citrina is an outstanding subject for containers and garden beds, placed in filtered or indirect light in a protected environment away from strong wind. Excessive exposure to sun results in rapid and severe scorching of the leaves and flowers. Use a well-drained, well-aerated, slightly acid medium containing plenty of organic matter, such as leaf mould and well-rotted compost. Add finely milled bark to the medium for container-grown plants, to improve drainage. Place the plants such that the roots and only the very base of the pseudostem are just below soil level. The plants perform admirably in large terracotta and plastic pots, and in troughs and wine barrels. They are particularly decorative when grown as specimen plants in large pots flanking shady garden stairs or on either side of a shady front door. They are ideally suited to the cool glasshouse and can also be grown in the home, provided it is only minimally heated in winter. In the garden, the flowers of var. citrina are effectively contrasted when inter-planted with reddish orange forms of var. miniata that flower simultaneously. It is also an ideal companion plant for shade-loving ferns, asparagus, low-growing plectranthus and the nettle, Laportea grossa. Once established, allow the plants to remain undisturbed for at least 5 years before division, or until flowering performance diminishes.

Container-grown plants perform best when their roots are slightly constricted, provided they are well fertilized. They are gross feeders and a recommended granular fertilizer such as 3:1:5 applied in early spring, early summer and late autumn, suits them well. Alternatively, apply a slow-release fertilizer in early summer or early autumn, and a seaweed extract fertilizer when the buds form, to ensure longer flower stems. After flowering, the attractive evergreen leaves and ripening yellow ripe berries provide continued interest in the garden. For container-grown plants, water heavily once or twice per week from spring to late autumn, and for garden beds, about once per week. In winter, reduce watering to once or twice per month in summer rainfall areas, however, in winter rainfall parts, they easily survive heavy rainfall, provided the soil is sufficiently well drained. Given sufficient shade, the plants are remarkably waterwise. They are frost tender and in susceptible areas, cover with a frost blanket; in marginal areas they can be grown under overhanging eaves or evergreen trees that provide some protection.

Propagate by dividing thick clumps straight after flowering or by sowing seed from ripe yellow berries in spring. Remove old flower heads and the older, outer leaves from divided plants, but do not cut off the remaining ones, replant immediately and water well. Remove the seeds from the berries once they start to turn yellow by peeling away the fleshy outer layer. Press each seed into a seedling medium such as one part coarse river sand and three parts finely milled, composted pine bark or decomposed pine needles in a deep seed tray, such that each seed is partially exposed. Place seed trays in a fairly warm (15–21°C), shaded, well-aerated place under cover, and water thoroughly once or twice per week with a watering can fitted with a fine rose-cap. Germination usually takes place within 4–8 weeks, and once they are a year old, plant them individually into 15 cm diameter pots or 1 litre nursery bags. In the spring of their second year, plant them into 20 cm diameter pots or 3 litre bags and allow to grow for a further year before planting out into permanent positions. Seedlings benefit from weekly applications of high nitrogen liquid fertilizers and in ideal conditions, can flower in 3 years. Bear in mind that seeds harvested from yellow berries will only produce 100% yellow-flowered offspring if the adults are ‘Group 1’ individuals that have been selfed or crossed with other members of ‘Group 1’, or if they are ‘Group 2’ individuals that have been crossed with other ‘Group 2’ individuals. Seeds from yellow clivias that have been open-pollinated will usually only yield a very small percentage of yellow offspring. An easy way to determine whether seedlings will produce yellow flowers or not, is by examining the base of the leaves during the first or second year of growth: if they are plain green (unpigmented) they will produce yellow flowers, but if they are pigmented with reddish maroon, the flowers will be reddish orange.

The pseudostem, leaves, flower stems and flower stalks, are highly susceptible to attack by the lily borer caterpillar (Brithys crini), especially in summer, resulting in discolouration and collapse of the whole plant in severe infestations. The night-flying moth lays her eggs mainly on the undersides of leaves and are difficult to spot. Crush young larvae by hand as soon as possible, or cut off and destroy heavily infested leaves. The European brown garden snail (Cornu aspersa) relishes the buds and flowers, and the leaves to a lesser extent, and can transmit viral disease. The leaves often look unsightly due to small, nocturnal, grey snout beetles that chew the margins, and should be removed by hand using a bright torch. If kept too wet, the leaf bases and pseudostem may succumb to bacterial soft rot. Lift the plant immediately, remove the affected portions and wash with water, then apply a fungicide and replant in sterilized sand to encourage new growth.",,#Fragrant,"The var. citrina itself has no recorded traditional, economic or magical uses, but the roots, rhizome and leaves of the reddish orange forms (var. miniata) are widely used by indigenous peoples of southern Africa. In the Eastern Cape, the Xhosa use decoctions of the roots to treat urinary conditions and childlessness. It is also said to relieve pain, and leaf infusions are used as a cleansing agent. Decoctions of the whole plant (except the flowers), are used to ease and hasten childbirth, and preparations of the rhizome are used to treat snakebite and fevers.

In KwaZulu-Natal, the Zulu make an infusion of the whole plant to sprinkle over their yards to ward off evil, and also use the roots as a love-charm emetic. Numerous toxic alkaloids have been isolated in var. miniata, as well as in C. caulescens, C. gardenii and C. nobilis, and all parts of the plant should be regarded as poisonous. Both var. citrina and var. miniata are used worldwide as spring-flowering ornamentals.",,,,,
Iridaceae,Iridaceae,,"The flowers are arranged in various ways, either in small clusters between large bracts, or in a spike (rarely solitary), with each flower held between two small or large bracts. The flowers are radially or bilaterally symmetrical with six tepals (petals). These may be similar to one another or different, usually with the upper larger. They are usually brightly coloured, sometimes with contrasting spots and stripes, and may be very fragrant. The petals are either separate or joined at the bottom into a short or long tube. The flowers of many Iridoideae, such as all Aristea species, last less than a single day, but in most species they last for three or four days.

Nearly worldwide but rare in tropical lowlands and at high latitudes. Iridaceae are best represented in southern Africa, especially the winter-rainfall region in the southwest. Other centres of diversity are temperate South and Central America (several small genera) and the Mediterranean (Iris and Crocus). About 1 800 species distributed among some 65 genera are recognised worldwide, just over half of them in southern Africa, where 38 genera are known. In the Cape Floral Region alone, 707 species and 27 genera are recorded.

The family is best represented in open, seasonal habitats. The richest areas for species in southern Africa are the montane grasslands of eastern South Africa, Swaziland and Lesotho, and the succulent karoo and fynbos of the Northern and Western Cape. Fewer species occur in savanna or the semi-arid central karoo, and very few in forest.","The largest genus in the family is Gladiolus (about 255 species), followed by Iris (about 225 species) and Moraea (about 200 species). Many species are very localised in occurrence. In the lowlands of the Western Cape in particular, farming and urban sprawl are threatening many species with extinction.

The family name is based on the genus Iris, the largest and best known genus in Europe. The genus Iris dates from 1753, when it was coined by Swedish botanist, Carl Linnaeus. Its name derives from the Greek goddess, Iris, who carried messages from Olympus to earth along a rainbow, whose colours were seen by Linnaeus in the multi-hued petals of many of the species.

Class: Angiosperm (Monocotyledon) Order: Asparagales","The three stamens are inserted at the base of the petals or just within the tube (if present), opposite the outer three tepals. They are either symmetrically clustered in the centre of the flower when this is radially symmetrical, or arched together under the upper tepal or onto the lower tepal in bilaterally symmetrical flowers. In some species of Moraea the stamen filaments are joined into a tube.

The ovary is inferior (superior in the Tasmanian Isophysis) with three locules each containing several to many ovules attached to the centre. Each flower has a single style that usually has three branches near the tip, each of these sometimes forked as well. In some genera (Dietes, Ferraria and most species of Moraea), the style branches are flattened and petal-like.

The fruit is a dry capsule that usually splits open along three sides to release the seeds. These are very variable in shape. In most genera they are tetrahedral or variously angled and without obvious adaptations for dispersal. Winged seeds adapted to wind dispersal characterise Gladiolus and Tritoniopsis, and also occur in some species of Hesperantha. Globular seeds with shiny coats that are relatively long-lived occur in several genera of Ixioideae. Chasmanthe aethiopica has fleshy seeds adapted to dispersal by birds, and several other species that grow in more wooded places, like Chasmanthe and some freesias, have reddish or black seeds that mimic fleshy seeds.",,"The species grow in all sorts of soils, derived from granite, basalt, dolerite, clay, limestone and sandstone, as well as rarer rocks like serpentine. Most species favour loamy soils, often among rocks where drainage is good, but some grow in marshes and others in pure sand. Species grow from just above the high tide mark (Gladiolusguienzii) to the top of the interior escarpment at over 3 000m.

Class: Angiosperm (Monocotyledon) Order: Asparagales

The family is currently divided into four subfamilies, but the results from DNA analysis suggest that several more should be recognised:

Members of Iridaceae occur in a great variety of habitats. About the only place they do not grow is in the sea itself, although Gladiolus gueinzii occurs on the seashore just above the high tide mark within reach of the spray. Most species are adapted to seasonal climates that have a pronounced dry or cold period unfavourable for plant growth and during which the plants are dormant. As a result most species are deciduous. Evergreen species are restricted to subtropical forests or savannah, temperate grasslands, and perennially moist fynbos. A few species grow in marshes or along streams, and some even grow only in the spray of seasonal waterfalls.

The above-ground parts (leaves and stems) of deciduous species die down when the bulb or corm enters dormancy. The plants thus survive periods that are unfavourable for growth by retreating underground.This is particularly useful in grasslands and fynbos, which are adapted to regular burning in the dry season. At this time the plants are dormant and their bulbs or corms are able to survive the heat of the fires underground. Veld fires clear the soil surface of competing vegetation, as well as fertilise it with ash. With the arrival of the first rains, the dormant corms are ready to burst into growth, sending up flowers and stems before they can be shaded out by other vegetation. Many grassland and fynbos irids flower best after fires, and some fynbos species will only flower in the season after a fire.

The family has a very diverse pollination ecology. Most species are pollinated by various species of solitary bees but many are adapted to pollination by sunbirds. These species typically have red to orange trumpet-like flowers that secrete large amounts of nectar. Other species are adapted to pollination by butterflies and moths, carrion flies and long-proboscid flies, and even monkey-beetles.

Several genera are important in horticulture, both as cut flowers and as garden plants. The most important cut flowers are Gladiolus, Iris and Freesia. In Northern Hemisphere gardens several species of Iris are grown (especially forms of Iris germanica, the bearded iris) and various cultivars of Crocosmia, while in South Africa species of Dietes, Watsonia, Ixia and Sparaxis are best known. The evergreen Dietes, with its tufts of narrow, grass-like leaves and prolific Iris-like flowers, is especially used in commercial plantings.",,#Fragrant,"The genus Crocus is grown commercially as the source of the spice saffron, which is the dried stigmas of the flowers. These are harvested by hand, hence the enormous price fetched by the spice. The corms of a few common species of Lapeirousia and Moraea formed part of the traditional diet of some African tribes.

The species vary greatly in their ease of cultivation and in their cultivation requirements. Generally speaking, species from the east coast, which has a less seasonal climate, are easiest in gardens. Species from the summer-rainfall regions require a dry winter resting period, while those from the winter-rainfall region require a cool, moist winter growing season and a dry summer.

Erica coccinea subsp. coccinea,Erica coccinea subsp. coccinea,,"Erica coccinea subsp. coccinea is a rigid, stoutly branched, bushy shrub, up to 1.2 m tall. Hanging tubular flowers are produced in threes, on the ends of short side branches. The flower-bearing side branches are closely packed towards the tips of the upright main branches, giving the effect of a spike-like inflorescence. The anthers are yellow-brown and protrude far from the flower tube. The sepals are coloured, and the bract and bracteoles are enlarged and clasp the calyx.

This is a variable species throughout its range. The length of the flower tubes can vary from ± 16 to 22 mm. The flower tubes may be smooth or hairy, dry or sticky. Flower colour is variable, it can be red, light red, pink, orange, yellow, brownish or green. Flowers are seen throughout the year in different localities. On the Cape Peninsula they flower mainly from autumn until spring (April-August). The leaves can be short, hard and curved, or long, smooth and tightly packed. Also, some plants have an underground rootstock that allows the plant to survive and resprout after a fire, whereas others don't.","The genus Erica gets its name from ereiko, to break, either because of the ability of the plant to break up bladder stones or more probably because the stems are brittle and break easily. The specific name coccinea means red or scarlet in Latin, and refers to the flower colour of the plant described by Linnaeus. It turns out not to be the best name chosen, as the flower colour is not only red but can be red, orange, yellow or greenish.

Erica coccinea has a rather complicated nomenclatural history. It has been described under different names by different botanists. A number of varieties were recognized, which have now been split into separate species. To add to the confusion, the name E. coccinea was given in error to another, unrelated red erica: E. abietina.

Linnaeus first named Erica coccinea in 1753, then changed his mind and called it Erica petiveri in 1771, by which name it was known for some time. But the rules of nomenclature give the earlier name priority, so Erica coccinea is the correct name. It was also described under the name E. sebana by Donn in 1796.

In 1767 P.J. Bergius described what is now Erica abietina subsp. abietina (red heath) under the name E. coccinea, despite the fact that Linnaeus had already described E. abietina in 1753. Bergius' Erica coccinea was subsequently found to be identical to Linnaeus' Erica abietina, and as E. abietina is the older name, and E. coccinea already applies to a different species, the name Erica abietina stands.

Erica coccinea was until recently regarded as a single variable species with a number of varieties. Oliver & Oliver revised the Erica coccinea complex in 2002. (The Erica coccinea complex contains: Erica coccinea (tassel heath), Erica melastoma (vlakteheide), Erica intermedia and Erica monadelpha.","This is a variable species throughout its range. The length of the flower tubes can vary from ± 16 to 22 mm. The flower tubes may be smooth or hairy, dry or sticky. Flower colour is variable, it can be red, light red, pink, orange, yellow, brownish or green. Flowers are seen throughout the year in different localities. On the Cape Peninsula they flower mainly from autumn until spring (April-August). The leaves can be short, hard and curved, or long, smooth and tightly packed. Also, some plants have an underground rootstock that allows the plant to survive and resprout after a fire, whereas others don't.

In the field, Erica coccinea is most often confused with E. plukenetii, but a closer look makes them easy to tell apart. Firstly, their foliage is different: the leaves of E. plukenetii are longer and curve upward and are arranged in whorls, while those of E. coccinea are shorter and curved downwards and are grouped in bunches or tufts. Secondly, there is a difference in their flowers: in E. coccinea the bract and bracteoles are large, and look like the sepals and are pressed against them (so that it looks like two 'sets' of sepals), whereas in E. plukenetii they are small and insignificant and are placed quite far from the sepals (so you see just the one 'set' of sepals and far down the flower stalk some tiny bracts).

Erica coccinea subsp. uniflora (Single-flowered Tassel Heath), differs from Erica coccinea subsp. coccinea in that the flowers are borne singly (not in threes), they are usually yellow, occasionally orange-red, and it occurs on lowland hills and flats not far from the coast, from the Cape Peninsula eastwards to near Mossel Bay.

Erica coccinea subsp. coccinea is widespread and common, and is found growing in a variety of habitats, including rocky flats, rocky outcrops, in rock crevices, on dry sandy flats or on cool wet slopes, on mountains from the Cederberg near Clanwilliam to the Kamanassie Mountains near George, including the Cape Peninsula.",,"Erica coccinea now consists of two subspecies: Erica coccinea subsp. coccinea and Erica coccinea subsp. uniflora; and its former varieties have been reclassified as follows:

Erica coccinea var. echiiflora is not a member of the Erica coccinea complex and has two conflicting descriptions:

Erica coccinea is visited by sunbirds, which feed on the nectar and while doing so, pollinate the flowers. The protruding anthers of Erica coccinea form a tube around the style, which has the effect of increasing the length of the flower. The anthers are joined to form a ring which is broken by the bird's beak as it probes inside to get to the nectar at the base of the flower tube. You can easily tell if a flower has been visited by a bird or not: freshly opened flowers have a single, tidy bunch of brown or yellow anthers at the tip of the tube whereas in a visited flower they are split apart and untidy-looking. As the anthers separate, they dust pollen onto the beaks and foreheads of the birds. At the same time, the stigma, which also protrudes from the flower, picks up pollen from the bird.

The flowers are also visited by bees and other insects that feed on the pollen or steal the nectar by biting holes through the base of the flower tube.

Erica coccinea is unusual in that some plants resprout and some do not. The different types are usually in different populations but sometimes plants growing together in the same population show this difference. Resprouters are multi-stemmed at ground level whereas reseeders are single-stemmed. Fynbos being fire-adapted, most species have evolved either the resprouting or reseeding strategy to survive fires. Resprouters survive the fire thanks to a lignotuber, a swollen stem base with many active buds and thick roots, and send out new growth after the fire. Reseeders are killed by a fire but the population survives by producing copious seeds that are either stored on the bush in pods or cones (serotiny), or carried off and stored by ants (myrmecochory) or dropped to lie dormant in the soil forming a seed bank, and germinate after the fire. Erica coccinea drops its seeds.

Not many species have evolved both strategies. A recent study shows that where the rainfall is reliable, the reseeding and resprouting Erica coccinea types are equally common. But, the resprouting E. coccinea type is more common on inland mountains where the rainfall is less reliable and the summer drought more intense. The reseeders are more vulnerable to erratic rainfall and frequent fires. Also, the reseeder populations have higher genetic diversity within the population and show greater genetic difference between populations when compared to resprouter populations. Resprouters are usually longer-lived than reseeders.

Grow Erica coccinea in well-drained soil, in a position that is sunny or gets morning to midday sun. It prefers a cool position, and fails to thrive in hot, dry positions, particularly those that get the hot afternoon sun. It prefers a well-watered site, but it must be well drained. Grow it in the fynbos garden, the coastal garden, in the cool rockery, on east, southeast- or southwest-facing terraces or where they are shaded for the later part of the day, or in containers. It is relatively long-lived, especially the plants that have a lignotuber. When growing ericas in containers, it is important to use the correct soil. It should be a well-drained, acidic (pH between 5 and 6.5), sandy loam, containing 50% well rotted compost, with no manure or strong fertiliser (use slow release or low doses).

Propagation by seed: Erica coccinea is easily grown from seed. Sow in late summer to autumn (March-May), in well-drained sandy soil. Keep warm and moist. Treatment with Instant Smoke Plus Seed Primer will enhance germination. Use a well-drained, acidic medium. Because the seed is so fine it needs only a light covering of clean sand, or the seeds can be mixed with dry sand and the layer of seed and sand spread in a thin layer on top of the sowing medium. Water with a fine rose to avoid displacing the seeds. Keep the trays damp but not wet and out of direct sun in a warm, but not hot, situation. Germination takes 1 to 2 months. Transplant the seedlings when they are about 10 mm high. Grow on in light shade until they are established.

Propagation by cuttings: Take semi-hardwood heel cuttings in late summer, autumn or spring. Treat with a rooting hormone suitable for semi-hardwood cuttings. Place in well-aerated medium, under mist on heated benches (24°C). Pot the rooted cuttings in a well-drained, acidic soil medium and harden off in light shade for a month or two. Although the species can be propagated by cuttings, because of its short, dense branching habit, it is often difficult to find suitable branches to use. Look for bushes in more shady positions where the growth is more elongated. At Kirstenbosch, we almost always propagate this erica by seed.",,#Fragrant,Erica coccinea is not used in traditional medicine.

Euclea undulata,Euclea undulata,,"Euclea undulata is a very sturdy, evergreen, dense and twiggy shrub to small tree reaching an approximate size of 7 m in height and very often with an equal width. The bushy and rounded appearance of the trees is due to the numerous branches that carry the closely packed leaves on stems that often reach ground level, giving an appearance of large dark green mounds or domes in the landscape. Several specimens commonly grow closely together, and in such cases they can form impenetrable thickets, as is often the case in their southern to coastal distribution range.","In southern Africa the Ebony family or Ebenaceae is represented by two genera namely Euclea and Diospyros. . The genus name Euclea means to be of good report, or to be famous, from the Greek eukleia, which is derived from eu meaning 'good', and kleios meaning report. It is suspected that this perhaps refers to the good quality ebony-type wood of some Euclea species, particularly that of Euclea pseudebenus . The specific name undulata is very apt and refers to the undulated or wavy appearance of the leaf blades. The species sometimes closely resembles E. divinorum which, however, has larger leaves and fruits. The inflorescences in Euclea undulata are also unbranched and less dense.","The leaves are opposite to subopposite or may be arranged in whorls of 3 or 4, mostly towards the ends of branchlets. Leaves are small, obovate to narrowly elliptical, 20-40 x 5-15 mm, stiff, leathery, dark green or blue-green above, paler below and sometimes rusty brown. The leaf apex is broadly tapering, or rounded to abruptly attenuate, base tapering, margin entire, finely rolled under, conspicuously wavy, or almost flat; petiole 1-3 mm long.

The bark is grey, scaly longitudinally fissured or cracked, particularly with age. The branchlets are twiggy, angular and densely leafy with short internodes

Flowers are small, whitish to cream, carried on unbranched 5- to 7-flowered spikes of up to 20 mm length, hairless but with rust-coloured stalked glands. The spikes are solitary in the leaf axils and are somewhat scented, appearing in summer, from December to May.

Fruits appear from February and are single-seeded rounded berries, 4-7 mm in diameter, thinly fleshy, reddish brown becoming dark when ripe, in short sprays less than 12 mm long. In adult plants flowers and fruits commonly occur simultaneously, resulting in prolonged presence of fruit or flowers or both for most of the year.

Euclea undulata occurs in a variety of climates ranging from tropical, subtropical and semi-arid to arid, where rainfall occurs either in winter, summer or right through the year. The species is found widespread over southern Africa, especially in South Africa, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Botswana and Namibia. It favours open rocky slopes, low hills with valleys, open mopane/acacia woodland, watercourses and areas with frequent or scattered termite mounds commonly referred to as heuweltjies' (little hills).

In South Africa these trees can be found almost throughout the country with the exception of the central interior associated with high altitude habitats. E. undulata is generally associated with rocky rather than deep sandy habitats. This fact, rather than the altitude, is probably the main reason why the species is absent in parts of the Kalahari with deep sand.",,"Euclea undulata is undoubtedly pollinated by insects such as bees who visit the scented flowers in abundance. Ants and honeydew-producing scale have also been noticed on the trees but it is suspected that they interact with each other rather than with the flowers. Although not very palatable, the leaves are browsed by a number of wildlife species and the fruit are eaten by birds and other mammals who disperse the seeds over large areas quite successfully.

Euclea undulata is a resprouter and in the wild recovers easily from grazing or other forms of physical damage. In cultivation the same holds true when specimens are cut or trimmed. However, since the species is a slow grower, it is not advisable to interfere with the natural shape of the plants. Plants should simply be left to occupy whichever space they have been provided with, and in this way will naturally mature in their own unique shape and character.

E. undulata is best grown from seeds which must be allowed to ripen completely after the fruits have blackened and have fallen to the ground. Seeds can be tested for viability using a simple floating test to see whether they are potentially fertile or not. Potentially fertile seeds (the ones that have sunk) are then soaked in hot water and left overnight and sowed into a sandy loam soil mixture which should not be fine-grained, otherwise this may encourage the formation of a crust and/or compaction. Best is to mix 1 part coarse river sand with 1 part fine-milled bark and 1 part decomposed compost or loam. The mixture is levelled in a seed tray and the seeds are pressed in and lightly covered with the same soil to about the size of the seeds. Sowing has been successful throughout the year but the best results are obtained from spring through to summer.Care must be taken not to transplant seedlings prematurely; therefore one must wait until seedlings have grown to at least 5-6 cm.

After plants have been hardened off for at least two seasons, they can be safely planted out in the garden in a sunny position. Young plants need to be protected from frost and should be watered generously during their initial years. Plants are very suitable for small drier gardens, especially in the Karoo and semidesert areas of South Africa. For the best effect at least three plants should be planted in a small group at least 6 m apart or closer, if a hedge effect is desired. Plants are most pleasing when combined with other drought-adapted or thicket species such as Acacia karoo, Carissa bispinosa, Ficus cordata, Searsia burchellii, Sideroxylon inerme or Pappea capensis. Other good companion shrubs and succulent species include Pteronia incana, Plumbago auriculata, Euryops linearis, Helichrysum petiolare, Pelargonium citronellum, P. crithmifolium, P. paniculatum, Aloe speciosa, A. microstigma, Ruschia caroli, R. maxima, Drosanthemum speciosum, D. micans, D. bicolor, Tylecodon paniculata and Cotyledon orbiculata.

",,#Fragrant,"Almost all parts of Euclea undulata are used by people or animals in one way or the other. It yields excellent firewood that produces long lasting coals.The leaves are useful as fodder for stock, antelope and small herbivorous mammals while the fruits are eaten by birds, antelope and humans although not very tasty. The hard brown heartwood is heavy and close-grained which make it durable and strong and a suitable species for making fencing posts. The bark contains suitable quantities of tannin and is used to ease headaches, while the roots provide a remedy for toothache and heart-related ailments. Alternatively the roots, when used as a powder, can be a drastic purgative. In the Western Cape leaf preparations are taken orally to treat diarrhoea and disorders of the stomach, and as a gargle to relieve throat ailments such as tonsillitis.",Euclea undulata is not endangered and occurs in abundance over a vast distribution range.,,,,
Crassula dejecta,Crassula dejecta,,"Crassula dejecta is a neat, densely branched, upright perennial shrublet, 400 mm tall. The leaves are slightly fleshy, often tinged red, with a row of rounded, bead-like hairs on the margins that give the leaves a silvery edge but which one needs a magnifying lens to see properly. There are also small downward-pointing hairs on the young branches that give the stems a silvery dusting and which one also needs a magnifying lens to see properly. The leaves are opposite, more or less the same length on the whole plant, and arranged densely in neat rows up the stems, giving a tidy, geometric effect.

The flowers are white, sometimes tinged pink, with red sepals, red ovaries that colour the centre of the open flowers red, and red anthers that age to brown. The flowers are carried in flat to round-topped, tight clusters at the ends of the branches during midsummer (Dec.-Feb.) and are honey-scented. The flowers develop into small capsules, each holding many tiny seeds.

","The name Crassula is the diminutive of the Latin crassus, which means thick or fat, referring to the fleshy nature of the genus as a whole. The Latin dejectus, -a, -um, means downcast, dismayed, subdued, dejected or drooping, hanging, cast down or low. But according to Stearn (1992), the botanical meaning of dejecta is debased, from the Latin dejectionem, meaning throw down or force down or cause to fall or let fall. I cannot find the reason why this species earned this name; it could be from the downward curving hairs on young stems, or because the specimen named by Jacquin was found growing on an overhanging ledge or had to be thrown down from a ledge.

Crassula dejecta was named in 1805 by Baron Nikolaus von Jacquin (1727-1817), professor of botany and chemistry and director of the botanic garden of the University of Vienna.","The genus Crassula is one of the most diverse succulent genera, varying from tiny moss-like annual plants to 2 m tall, succulent trees such as C. ovata. There are more than 300 Crassula species of which approx. 150 are found in southern Africa where they are widespread but concentrated in the semi-arid, winter rainfall areas. The centre of distribution of this genus is in southern Africa, but they extend beyond Africa into Europe, America, Australia, New Zealand and the southern islands.

Crassula dejecta is found growing on south- or southwest-facing slopes or in kloofs, on rock outcrops, on ledges or in rock crevices from the Riviersonderend Mountains to near Stellenbosch in the Western Cape, northward through the Cederberg as far as Springbok in Namaqualand, Northern Cape. It is found in both the Fynbos and Succulent Karoo Biomes.

","Crassulas have an extraordinary metabolism known as Crassulacean Acid Metabolism or CAM that allows them to photosynthesize normally without losing much water through their leaves; this gives them the ability to survive and thrive in dry regions or areas that experience recurring droughts.

All plants need CO2 (carbon dioxide) for photosynthesis. Most plants take in CO2 during daylight hours through their stomata (pores in the leaves) and can't avoid losing water at the same time through these open pores. In Crassula the stomata are closed during the day but open at night so that when they take in the CO2 they lose the least amount of water. The CO2 taken in at night is stored in the form of organic crassulacean acids. During the day, these acids are broken down and the CO2 is released and re-used in the photosynthetic process.

In this way they lose much less water yet can photosynthesize normally during the daylight hours. Furthermore, during extremely dry periods they won't even open their stomata at night, and will recycle the CO2 within the cells. They won't be able to grow at all but the cells will be kept healthy, a process known as CAM-idling.","Crassulas are easy to grow and Crassula dejecta is no exception. It does best when planted in well-drained soil, and fed with well-rotted compost and frequent low doses of organic fertilizer. Do not over-water. It does well in sun, or semi-shade and can be grown in a position that is light, as in open to the sky, but may only get direct sun for a short part of the day e.g. on the south or southwest side of the house. It makes an excellent water-wise groundcover if planted en masse. It forms a neat little bush that looks good on the edge or near the front of borders and in mixed plantings, and is perfect for the water-wise garden, fynbos garden, and in rockeries. It also makes an attractive container plant and can be grown on the windowsill or indoors where it gets bright light.

Crassula dejecta is easily propagated by seed or cuttings. Being a plant from the winter rainfall region, seed is best sown in autumn, but it will germinate if sown in spring or early summer. Sow on the surface of a well-drained, sterile medium or sprinkle seed with clean coarse sand in a thin layer on the surface of the sowing medium. Keep moist and well ventilated.Cuttings can be taken at any time of the year and they root easily without the need for misting, bottom heat or even rooting hormones. They can be rooted in a well-drained medium in a cold-frame, or planted directly where they are intended to grow - in the Cape this is best done during autumn.

",,#Fragrant,"There is no record of Crassula dejecta being used medicinally, although some other Crassula species are used in traditional medicine, or as charms.

Agapanthus praecox,Agapanthus praecox,,"Agapanthus is a very variable genus, yet they are all broadly similar in appearance, with rhizomatous roots, strap-like leaves and an umbellate inflorescence on a stalk held above the leaves. Botanists have always found it tricky to classify them into distinct species. Frances Leighton revised the genus in 1965, recognizing ten species in total: four evergreen species, viz. A. africanus, A. comptonii, A. praecox and A. walshii and six deciduous species, viz. A. campanulatus, A. caulescens, A. coddii, A. dyeri, A. inapertus and A. nutans. Zonneveld & Duncan (2003), using nuclear DNA content and pollen vitality and colour, as well as morphology, now consider A. comptonii to be identical to A. praecox subsp. minimus; A. walshii to be a subspecies of A. africanus; A. dyeri to be identical to A. inapertus subsp. intermedius; and A. nutans to be identical to A caulescens. As a result there are now only two evergreen species i.e. A. africanus and A. praecox and four deciduous species i.e. A. campanulatus, A. caulescens, A. coddii and A. inapertus, making six species in total.","The genus Agapanthus was established by L'Heritier in 1788. It used to be included in the Liliaceae (lily family), was then moved to the Amaryllidaceae (amaryllis and daffodil family), moved again into the Alliaceae (onion family) then back to Amaryllidaceae and now resides in its own family, the Agapanthaceae. All this taxonomic to-and-fro'ing seems to be about whether its umbellate inflorescence is considered to be of greater taxonomic importance than its superior ovary. It is placed in its own family, a sister family to the Amaryllidaceae, on the strength of its superior ovary, the presence of saponins and the absence of amaryllid alkaloids.

The Agapanthaceae is a monotypic family (consists of only one genus) that is endemic to southern Africa, i.e. Agapanthus occurs naturally nowhere else on Earth. The six variable species are widespread in all the provinces of South Africa except for the Northern Cape, and in Lesotho, Swaziland and Mozambique, but not in Namibia or Botswana. They occur only in areas where the rainfall is more than 500 mm (20 inches) per annum, from sea level to 2 000 m (7000 ft), with a distribution range that extends from the Cape Peninsula in the southwest, along the southern and eastern coast of southern Africa then inland and northwards into the mountainous regions south of the Limpopo River.

The name Agapanthus is derived from the Greek agapé, love, and anthos, flower. There is no clear reason for this derivation although it could be interpreted as 'lovely flower' or 'flower of love'. Agapeo means 'to be contented with' which is a possible derivation, i.e. 'flower with which I am well pleased'. The specific name praecox means early, premature, unseasonable or precocious in Latin, and was possibly given because compared to the other species it is an early flowerer; minimus means smallest, which it is; and orientalis of the east, which is most likely a case of mistaken origin. Quite often in those days, the ships carrying the new plant material back to Europe came from the East, via the Cape, and some of the botanists assumed that all the plants on board came from the East.

Agapanthus has attracted a few common names over the years. In its first publication in Europe in 1679 it was called the African hyacinth. Linnaeus called it the African lily, and nowadays in Europe and America it is still known as the African lily, but also rather inappropriately as lily of the Nile. In South Africa they are commonly referred to as agapanthus.

","The evergreen species come from the winter rainfall Western Cape and all-year rainfall Eastern Cape and shed a few of their old outer leaves every year and replace them with new leaves from the apex of the growing shoot. The deciduous species come from the summer rainfall Eastern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal, Swaziland, Free State, Lesotho, Gauteng, Mpumalanga, Limpopo and Mozambique, and grow rapidly in spring with the onset of the rains, and then lose their leaves completely and lie dormant during winter. Deciduous species covered on this website to date include A. coddii, and A. inapertus with its dark blue clone 'Graskop'.

Agapanthus praecox, one of the evergreens, is an extremely variable species consisting of three subspecies: subsp. praecox, subsp. orientalis and subsp. minimus. It can be recognized by its 6-20 leaves per individual plant. These leaves are strap-like and may be leathery or flaccid, narrow or broad, short or long and have blunt or pointed tips. Although this description is very broad, it is relatively easy to tell it apart from the other evergreen species: A. africanus is restricted to Western Cape, mainly from the Cape Peninsula to Paarl and Stellenbosch, and as far eastwards as Swellendam. Its range does not overlap with that of A. praecox. It is small, 250 to 700 mm, flowers in late summer (December to April) and its perianth is thick or fleshy in texture and the leaves are leathery.

Agapanthus praecox subsp. praecox occurs in Eastern Cape. It is generally 0.8 to 1 m tall and flowers in mid to late summer (December - February). It is distinguished from the other two subspecies by its longer perianth segments (50 mm or longer) and fewer leaves (10-11 per plant) which are leathery and suberect (spreading rather than arching). Flowers are open-faced and medium blue.

Agapanthus praecox subsp. orientalis (F.M.Leight.) F.M. Leight. occurs in Eastern Cape and southern KwaZulu-Natal and is also generally 0.8 to 1 m tall and flowers in mid to late summer (December - February). It is distinguished from subsp. praecox by its shorter perianth segments (less than 50 mm), and it has more leaves (up to 20 per plant) which are not leathery and have an arching habit. It differs from subsp. minimus by having a more dense inflorescence, the whole plant is larger and it forms thick clumps. Flowers are open-faced, pale to medium blue or pure white.

Agapanthus praecox subsp. minimus (Lindl.) F.M.Leight. occurs in the southeastern Western Cape and Eastern Cape, is smaller than the other two, only 300 to 600 mm tall, and starts flowering earlier, from early to late summer (November to March). It differs from the other two subspecies in being a smaller plant, with fewer leaves per plant (up to 10) and there are fewer flowers in the inflorescence. It has shorter perianth segments than subsp. praecox (less than 50mm) and it does not form as dense clumps as subsp. orientalis. Flowers are open-faced, pale to dark blue or occasionally greyish white or white.","Agapanthus species are easily able to hybridize with each other, particularly when grown in close proximity and as a result, a bewildering array of garden hybrids have arisen. At Kirstenbosch in addition to having many examples of the pure, wild-collected Agapanthus species on display, we have a number of different forms of the species, both of garden origin and wild-collected. Those that we have for A. praecox are shown below.

","Many gardeners and even some authors of publications mistakenly call the agapanthus in cultivation A. africanus. This is almost certainly incorrect. A. africanus is a winter rainfall plant and is difficult in cultivation, needing very well-drained soil, hot, dry summers and wet winters. Practically all the evergreen agapanthus in cultivation in the world, are hybrids or cultivars of A. praecox.

Agapanthus praecox is easy to grow and it does well even in the poorest of soils, but it must receive some water in summer. To perform at its best, give it rich, well-drained soil with ample compost (decayed organic matter) and plenty of water in spring and summer. As with most plants they benefit most from regular (e.g. weekly) deep drenching as opposed to frequent superficial waterings. It prefers full sun, and some cultivars will flower in semi-shade. All the evergreen agapanthus are best lifted and divided every four years or so to ensure flowering. A. praecox will tolerate light frost, but is hardy only in the milder parts of the Northern Hemisphere, like the southwest of England and in the Mediterranean. In areas with extreme winter temperatures they are best grown in the cool greenhouse, or in containers that can be taken into a greenhouse during winter.

Agapanthus praecox is ideal for mass displays, the larger species and cultivars are wonderful as a backdrop to the herbaceous border, whereas the smaller ones are excellent in the front of the border, or as an edging plant or in rockeries. They are a good companion for winter growing plants like Chasmanthe floribunda. All of them make good pot plants. A. praecox is also an excellent plant to use to stabilize a bank and to prevent erosion, and in difficult seaside gardens they stand up to the wind. A. praecox is an excellent cutflower, either whole heads, or individual flowers in small arrangements or wired and used in bouquets and posies.

Propagation is by seed or division. Because agapanthus plants hybridize freely with each other, and are all in flower at the same time, you can be sure that there will be hybrids from seed harvested in the Kirstenbosch Garden. To get pure seed of any Agapanthus species it would have to be habitat collected or pollinated under strictly controlled conditions. Even then, there is always a degree of variation in the offspring. If you are after a particular cultivar, division is still the most reliable way of making sure that the material being propagated will be exactly true to type.

Seed can be sown fresh, in late summer - autumn, but in cold climates it can be kept refrigerated (not frozen) and sown in spring. It must be kept in the refrigerator or it will perish. Seed should be sown in deep (10 cm) trays, in a mixture of equal parts river sand and fine compost, and kept semi-shaded and moist. Seed germinates readily within six to eight weeks. The seed should be sown thinly as the seedlings will stay in the tray for their first year. Seedlings should be potted up into individual containers during their second year and can be planted into the garden or permanent pots in their third year. Flowering can be expected from their third or fourth year.

Clumps are best lifted and divided just after the end of their flowering period in early March (late summer - autumn). Unlike the deciduous species, which should be left alone for up to 6 years and often don't flower the first year after being divided, the evergreens are best lifted every four years and usually flower best in their first season after dividing. You need your health and strength to lift and divide large agapanthus clumps - what works well is to place two garden forks back to back in the centre of the clump and prize them apart. Or the clump can be chopped up with a spade. Reduce the length of the foliage by one half and reduce the roots by two-thirds. Replant immediately and water thoroughly.

Agapanthus praecox is generally pest- and disease-free. Foliage may be attacked by red spider mites, thrips, and mealy bug but need only be sprayed if infestation is severe. Agapanthus are famous for harbouring snails, although the snails do not seem to cause any damage to the plants themselves. The best way to combat them is to remove them by hand or to keep ducks. Botrytis, visible as brownish lesions, may attack the flowers preventing them from opening. There is no cure, it can only be prevented by spraying before and after the buds break open. The foliage may be attacked by the fungus Macrophoma agapanthii causing die-back of the leaves, and in severe cases can be combatted with a fungicide like mancozeb or captab as a full cover spray.",,#Fragrant,"Agapanthus is considered to be both a magical and a medicinal plant, and the plant of fertility and pregnancy. Xhosa women use the roots to make antenatal medicine, and they make a necklace using the roots that they wear as a charm to bring healthy, strong babies. The Zulu use agapanthus to treat heart disease, paralysis, coughs, colds, chest pains and tightness. It is also used with other plants in various medicines taken during pregnancy to ensure healthy children, or to augment or induce labour. It is also used as a love charm and by people afraid of thunderstorms, and to ward off thunder. Margaret Roberts advises hikers to put leaves in their shoes to soothe the feet, and to wrap weary feet in the leaves for half an hour. The long, strap-like leaves also make an excellent bandage to hold a dressing or poultice in place, and winding leaves around the wrists are said to help bring a fever down.

Agapanthus contains several saponins and sapogenins that generally have anti-inflammatory (reduce swelling and inflammation), anti-oedema (oedema = swelling due to accumulation of fluid), antitussive (relieve or suppress coughing) and immunoregulatory (have influence on the immune system) properties. Although the precise activity of agapanthus compounds is not known, preliminary tests have shown uterotonic activity (increases the tone of uterine muscles).

Agapanthus is suspected of causing haemolytic poisoning in humans, and the sap causes severe ulceration of the mouth.",,,,,
Cryptostephanus,Cryptostephanus,,"Cryptostephanus species are solitary or sometimes clump-forming perennials, and all have rhizomatous rootstocks with well developed, fleshy roots that are sometimes tuberous in the lower part (C. haemanthoides). They have dark green or intensely glaucous (greenish grey), strap-shaped leaves produced in two opposite rows from an erect pseudostem, and are either evergreen (C. vansonii) or deciduous and summer-growing (C. densiflorus, C. haemanthoides).","The generic name Cryptostephanus is derived from the Greek words kryptós (hidden), and stephanus (a crown), and is descriptive of the partially hidden, crown-like structure of linear appendages attached to the inner tip of the perianth tube.

The first known member of the genus was C. densiflorus, found in January 1860 by the Austrian medic, explorer and botanist, Dr Friedrich M.J. Welwitsch (1806–1872) of Welwitschia fame. He collected it in the mountains of Huíla Province in the temperate southwestern region of Angola, and it was described by the Kew botanist J.G. Baker in volume 7 of the Journal of Botany, in 1878. The specific name densiflorus is derived from the Latin words densus (meaning crowded) and florus (meaning flower) and is descriptive of the sometimes dense arrangement of flowers on the flower head.

The second species to be described was C. haemanthoides, found in February1877 by the German explorer J.M. Hildebrandt (1847–1881) southeast of Tsavo National Park in southern Kenya, and described by the German botanist Ferdinand Pax in volume 15 of Botanische Jahrbücher, in 1893. The specific name haemanthoides is derived from the Greek haima (blood) and -oides (resembling), alluding to the haemanthus-like shape of the flower head.

The third species, C. vansonii, was first collected in the early 1940’s by the Russian naturalist Georges van Son in the Vumba Mountains of eastern Zimbabwe. He grew the plant in his garden in Pretoria where it flowered and was later described by the South African botanist Dr Inez Verdoorn in volume 23 of The Flowering Plants of South Africa, in 1943. The specific name vansonii is the Latinized version of the discoverer’s name.

Within the family Amaryllidaceae, Cryptostephanus belongs to the tribe Haemanthae, which includes the genera Apodolorion, Clivia, Gethyllis, Haemanthus and Scadoxus. Together with Clivia and Scadoxus, Cryptostephanus is one of only three genera in the African Amaryllidaceae which does not have a true bulb, but a rhizomatous rootstock.

","Cryptostephanus densiflorus is native to the Kaokoveld Centre of Endemism in the northwestern corner of Namibia and the extreme southwestern part of Angola. It occurs in deciduous woodland (Ernst van Jaarsveld personal communication) and is nowhere very common, growing as occasional solitary individuals or in small groups in openings between trees and shrubs in full sun, usually in sandy soil between rock slabs. The plants receive plentiful summer rainfall but undergo a very dry winter dormant period.

C. vansonii is endemic to the Eastern Highlands of Zimbabwe in the cool, moist forests of the Vumba and southern Chimanimani Mountains, and to the adjacent forests of western Mozambique. It grows in colonies in decomposing leaf litter amongst rocks on the forest floor, in deep shade.

C. haemanthoides is the most widespread species and has a disjunct distribution. It occurs in southern Kenya, is widespread across Tanzania, and is also recorded from southwestern Angola; it could possibly also occur in Zambia and in the southern Democratic Republic of Congo. Its habitat is variable, including grassland in full sun, in sandy or clay soils, as well as in dappled shade on rocky slopes near rivers and in forested gorges, usually between, or occasionally upon, granite boulders (lithophytic).","The peduncle (flower stem) is laterally compressed, with two sharp, longitudinal ridges, and bears sparse or dense pseudo-umbels (flower heads) of white, light pink, maroon, brownish or purplish maroon, tubular flowers, with short or long, straight or curved, perianth tubes. The flowers have suberect, spreading or recurved tepals and are characterized in having a partially hidden, crown-like structure (a corona) consisting of 6 or 12 narrow appendages attached to the inner tip of the perianth tube. There are 6 stamens which are included within the perianth tube or slightly protruding. The inferior ovary is round and the straight, erect, white style is included within the perianth tube or slightly protruding, with a flattened, head-like stigma.

The fruit is a round, shiny or matt, bright red or pinkish red, fleshy berry containing hard, egg-shaped or more or less round, white, fleshy seeds, surrounded by a thin phytomelanous coat (a brown, or blackish brown organic, crust-like covering). The basic chromosome number for Cryptostephanus is x = 12.
","There are three species of Cryptostephanus and they are most closely related to Clivia, an evergreen genus with similar perennial fleshy roots, strap-shaped leaves produced in opposite ranks from a pseudostem, a similar laterally compressed peduncle, and mostly tubular flowers with fleshy berries and hard, fleshy seeds.

Cryptostephanus densiflorus and C. haemanthoides are deciduous, summer-growing plants which are dormant in winter, whereas C. vansonii is evergreen. Flowering takes place from October to March. The flowers of C. vansonii are strongly self-fertile in cultivation, readily setting seed in enclosed, insect-free conditions. The long-tubed flowers of C. haemanthoides are self-sterile and very short-lived, remaining fully open for no more than one day (Adam Harrower personal communication). The curved flowers of C. densiflorus are also self-sterile and contain small amounts of nectar in their inflated bases, indicating a possible adaptation to bird pollination. They are also short-lived, individual flowers barely lasting three days before dropping off. The red or pinkish red fleshy berries of Cryptostephanus take up to nine months to mature and are probably eaten and dispersed by birds and monkeys.

All Cryptostephanus species require a frost-free environment and the evergreen C. vansonii is the most easily cultivated member, performing very well in light or deep shade. Plant the rootstocks in decomposing organic matter such as acidic leaf mould, or a mixture of equal parts of acidic composted bark and coarse grit. They are ideally suited to containers and also grow well outdoors in mild climates, such as in the southern suburbs of Cape Town, provided it has sufficient shade and a very well-drained growing medium. Potted plants only need one heavy watering every two weeks and must not be kept constantly wet. In ideal conditions it is a long-lived plant, lasting 30 years or more, and forms occasional offsets.

C. densiflorus performs fairly well in containers in a sharply drained medium consisting of grit and coarse river sand mixed in equal proportion, with a layer of well-rotted compost placed at the base of the container. It likes a 20–25 cm diameter container, with the top of the rhizome placed just below soil level. The rootstock is extremely sensitive to over-watering; at the beginning of the growing season in early summer, apply an initial drench, and once the leaf shoots appear within two to three weeks, apply a weekly drench until the end of summer. When the leaves begin to turn yellowish brown, gradually decrease drenching to once fortnightly, and finally withhold moisture altogether once the leaves have almost fully desiccated. Do not store the rootstock bare-rooted over the dormant period but leave it in its dry medium until the onset of new growth in early summer. This species does not form offsets.

C. haemanthoides is the most difficult species to grow. The most commonly encountered problem is rotting of the rhizome and fleshy roots due to over-watering in summer, and to excessive desiccation during the winter-dormant months. Depending on the origin of the form being grown, place C. haemanthoides rhizomes in a lightly shaded or sunny place and plant in a 20–25 cm diameter container in an acid medium such as equal parts of composted bark mixed with coarse grit. Follow the same watering procedure for C. densiflorus (see above), but bear in mind that C. haemanthoides plants go dormant earlier, usually in mid-summer, and begin growth earlier, usually in late winter. The plants are usually solitary but may occasionally form offsets.

Seeds of C. haemanthoides germinate fairly easily within a couple of months but seedlings are susceptible to damping-off fungi (Adam Harrower personal communication). Seeds of C. vansonii are notoriously slow to germinate, and nothing is known about germinating seeds of C. densiflorus. Remove the outer red, fleshy layer from the ripe berries to obtain the seeds. Place the seeds onto the surface of a well-aerated medium such as equal parts of composted bark and coarse grit in deep pots or seed trays and half-cover with the same medium. Using a watering can with a fine rose, water with a contact fungicide and keep the medium slightly moist but not wet. Seeds of C. vansonii can also be sown this way but may take many months to germinate; alternatively, allow the seeds of this species to germinate within the ripe fruits, while still attached to the ovary wall, then remove seedlings and pot-up individually. The juvenile period for C. vansonii is three to four years in ideal conditions, but is unknown for C. haemanthoides and C. densiflorus. Once well established, leave cryptostephanus plants undisturbed for at least five years before re-potting. Offsets of C. vansonii are best separated and replanted in spring.

The leaf upper surfaces of all three species are susceptible to infestation by red spider mites in warm, enclosed, greenhouse conditions, so place the plants in a well-ventilated area. The tunics surrounding the rhizomes sometimes become infested with mealy bugs, and the leaf margins are sometimes chewed by snout beetles.",,#Fragrant,"Cryptostephanus has no cultural or magical uses, but it is used to a limited extent as a container plant by specialist bulb-growers; C. vansonii is the most commonly grown species. Cryptostephanus densiflorus and C. haemanthoides are extremely rare in cultivation.

","None of the Cryptostephanus species have been formally assessed, but it is likely that none are threatened, due to their occurrence in mostly inaccessible terrain.

Aloe genus,Aloe genus,,"Aloes come in a variety of growth forms, from small miniatures to tall single-stemmed or branched trees, while certain species even form large, tangled shrubs. The usually swollen and succulent leaves are more or less lance- or sword-shaped in outline and boat-shaped in cross-section. Leaves are arranged in terminal clusters (rosettes) and are armed along their margins with usually sharp, but sometimes soft, teeth.

Flowers are grouped in candle-like or cone-shaped inflorescences, which can be branched or simple.

The most common shape of flowers found in Aloe is tubular flowers, although some species have curved or even bell-shaped flowers. Flowers are typically brightly coloured and most often in various hues of red, orange and yellow, but there are also some species with green, pink or white flowers. The vast majority of aloes flower in winter, while some groups, like the grass aloes for instance, usually flower in spring or summer.","The origin of the genus name Aloe is uncertain, but the most popularly accepted suggestions are that it is derived from: the Arabic alloch or alloeh, a vernacular name for medicinally used members of the genus; or the Greek aloë, referring to the dried juice of aloe leaves.

The vast majority of aloes flower in winter, while some groups, like the grass aloes for instance, usually flower in spring or summer.

Aloe fruit are capsules that dry out and split open to release the mature small, brown to black, angled seeds that sometimes have a narrow or prominent translucent or white wing. The wing is thought to aid wind dispersal of the seeds. There are a group of ± 20 aloes from Madagascar and the Mascarene islands that have a fleshy berry, which does not dry out completely and become woody. These berried aloes are sometimes separated into the genus Lomatophyllum Willd. and their leaves are generally not as succulent as those of other aloes.

Aloes are mostly long-lived plants, especially the larger species. A specific quiver tree (Aloidendron dichotomum) was estimated to be between 100-145 years old, while some exceptionally tall specimens (of over 10 m) of Aloe marlothii may even be over 200 years old.

Aloes are prominent components of many, mainly arid, African landscapes. There are currently ±600 different aloes recognised. Members of the genus can be found in Africa (±405), the Arabian Peninsula (±45), Socotra (4), Madagascar (±145) and the Mascarene and other Western Indian Ocean Islands (±7).

On the African continent aloes occur over much of Sub-Saharan Africa, although they are mainly concentrated in the southern and eastern regions of the continent; only two or three aloes are found in western Africa. High centres of aloe diversity are found in South Africa (±155), Madagascar (±145), Tropical East Africa (i.e. Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda; ±85), the Horn of Africa region (i.e. Ethiopia, Eritrea and Somalia; ±76) and the Arabian Peninsula (±45).

In South Africa the ±155 species of aloe can be found in almost all vegetation types, from the arid to semi-arid regions of the Karoo, the winter rainfall fynbos region, succulent thickets, grassland and savanna, and even in comparatively high-rainfall forests. Most aloes have small or fairly limited distribution ranges, and are often associated with only one of these vegetation regions, but a few are widespread, like Aloe arborescens and Aloe maculata.

",,"Aloes are well-adapted to the often arid conditions found in their natural environment. Their succulent leaves enable them to survive prolonged periods of drought. Sharp thorns and spines, as well as usually bitter leaf sap, are good deterrents for many herbivores, although certain animals seem completely undaunted by these defence mechanisms of aloes and the juicy leaves are often eaten.

Aloes often occur in environments that are prone to regular fires. Several strategies exist through which plants survive these fires. Some aloes are resprouters; fires can completely kill the above-ground parts, but plants have a thick underground rootstock that resprouts. Other aloes survive fires by growing in fire protected habitats; these are most often rocky outcrops, where the fire is not as severe as in the surrounding grassland vegetation. Many stemmed aloes retain their old dry leaves around their stem and this acts as an insulator against the heat of fires.

Brightly coloured, tubular flowers that are filled with nectar are a welcome source of food during the winter. Aloe flowers are regularly visited by pollinating birds and insects, but also by pollen and nectar thieves (these can be insects, birds or mammals) that do little in terms of pollination; some can even destroy an inflorescence completely.

Their natural adaptation to harsh and often arid climates, makes aloes superb subjects for the water-wise garden. Aloes can tolerate long periods of drought, but it is not true that watering should be withheld to obtain optimal growth. Stressed plants are more susceptible to insects and pests. Plants thrive, flower better and are more resistant when given adequate water during the growing season. However, be very careful not to overwater aloes as this can cause them to rot, especially when the soil does not drain well.

Although there are some species that are very difficult or even impossible to grow successfully, the vast majority of the more common aloes are easy and can readily be grown almost anywhere in the country. Aloes generally require soils with good drainage and do best in warm climates. When planted in rich soil that are regularly mulched plants will do well for many years without intervention and are thus require very low maintenance once established. Extra protection may be necessary in cold areas as very few aloes can withstand severe frost. To ensure success it is necessary to know the conditions under which a species grow in their natural habitat and to choose aloes that will naturally do well in the particular area and local climate where you live.

Propagation

Seed: Propagating aloes from seed is relatively easy and germination usually starts within one week of sowing. Seed should be harvested as soon as the capsules are dry and start to split open. A resting period is not required and seed should be sown fresh if possible. In South Africa the best months to sow seed is from August to February. Use a mixture containing equal parts of sifted compost and coarse river sand, sow seed over the surface and cover with a very thin layer of soil or pure sand, followed by a layer of pea-sized gravel. The gravel layer provides support for the emerging seedlings which have a very weak root system and are very tender during their first few months. In nature seedlings are usually found in the shelter and shade of Ã¢e~nurse' or companion plants. Try to imitate this by keeping the seedling trays in the shade. Seedlings can be transplanted once three true leaves have formed, usually after about a year.

Cuttings: Cuttings are a popular and reliable way of propagating tree and shrub-like aloes. Stem cutting should be allowed to dry in the shade for a few days or even weeks, and then planted in the intended spot in the garden. Leaving cuttings to dry before replanting allows for the wound to heal and dry. This much reduces the risk of fungal infection and eventual rotting of the entire cutting. Plants grown from cuttings will reach maturity faster than plants grown from seed.

Division: Suckering aloes that form large clumps of many rosettes can be propagated by splitting a clump into individual plants. Suckers and small plants should be removed from the mother plant with a sharp knife. These should also preferably be left to dry in the shade before planting, especially if the suckers do not yet have roots of their own. Plants that already have roots can be planted into their required places or pots, and will become established faster than rootless plantlets. As in the case of cuttings, plants grown from clump division will reach maturity faster than plants grown from seed.

",,#Fragrant,"Economic and cultural value Aloes have a very long history of medicinal, cosmetic and cultural uses. Many early civilizations were familiar with the healing properties of Aloe vera in particular. This species likely originates from the Arabian Peninsula, but is today cultivated almost world-wide and has become naturalised in many areas. Over the past decades the use of Aloe ferox, indigenous to South Africa, in the traditional pharmaceutical and cosmetic industry has increased significantly.

Parts of the leaf, but especially the leaf sap and the leaf pulp or gel, is variously used as a laxative, vermifuge, or to treat arthritis, conjunctivitis and sinusitis. It displays antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties and is recently also claimed to have antiviral properties.This makes it a very commonly used remedy for skin irritations, cuts, abrasions, minor burns, sunburn and bruises. Aloe sap (or bitters) or gel are included in health tonics, nutritional supplements, cosmetics and skin-care products such as shampoos, soaps and moisturising lotions. Aloes also have various culinary uses in the form of marmalade, jams, pickles and preserves.

Some aloes are part of cultural superstitions, i.e. Aloe variegata (kanniedood) is planted on graves to ensure eternal life. In rural areas aloes are often used as live animal enclosures or as natural hedges and boundary fences. They have even been employed on road cuttings, etc. to stabilise the soil and prevent soil erosion.

Aloes are very popular and some of the most rewarding plants to cultivate. They make excellent accent plants owing to their often strange and inspiring architectures, as well as the bright flowers that offset the grey-green leaves. They are also very suitable as container plants and small aloes can be used very effectively as border plants at the edge of a bed. Although aloes are most often included in rockeries, their application in horticulture is not limited to this feature and they can be used in almost any setting and in conjunction with most common garden plants.","All species of Aloe (except for A. vera L.) appear on CITES (Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) Appendices, meaning that trade in aloes is controlled to prevent utilisation that would be incompatible with their survival. A total of 21 species, including varieties of some of these species, are included in Appendix I and trade in specimens of these species is permitted only in exceptional circumstances. The other aloes are all on Appendix II and therefore certain permits are required to trade in these aloes.

In South Africa most aloes are also protected, with very few exceptions, by environmental legislation in all nine provinces. It is thus illegal to remove plants from their natural habitat without the necessary collecting and transport permits issued by a provincial or other nature conservation authority, and consent from the land owner.

In the latest Red List of South African Plants, a total of 46 aloes are listed as species of conservation concern: Critically Endangered: 5; Endangered: 4; Vulnerable: 15; Near-threatened: 10; Rare: 9; Declining: 1; Data Deficient –Insignificantly known: 2.

Common threats listed for the survival of these aloes are restricted distribution ranges, habitat destruction and fragmentation, collecting for horticultural purposes, invasive alien encroachment, and harvesting for medicinal purposes.

,Syncolostemon canescens," strongly aromatic foliage

The genus Syncolostemon contains about 45 species, found mainly in Africa, with 38 species in southern Africa, one in Madagascar and one in India. Belonging to the Lamiaceae or sage family, which includes many important herbs, such as mint and sage. Many members of this family are highly aromatic and have the identifying feature of square stems. Noteworthy members that belong to this family are Leonotis, Mentha, Ocimum, Plectranthus and Salvia.

The aromatic oils in the leaves act as a chemical defence against plant-eating insects or animals, making them unpalatable or difficult to digest.","Syncolostemon canescens is an attractive, herbaceous perennial, 250–600 mm tall, with strongly aromatic foliage. Woody based stems, covered in long, greyish hairs, grow upright, branching near the base, with longest in the middle and shortest near the edge, which gives the plant a naturally rounded habit. Leaves are opposite, linear to lanceolate, 25–55 × 3–15 mm, with a short petiole, and short grey hairs on both surfaces, varying from densely to sparsely covered, giving the foliage a rough texture, which is enhanced by the finely to coarsely toothed margin.

The inflorescence is 70–250 mm long, standing well above the foliage, made up of many, small, white to mauve to purplish, tubular flowers, presented in verticils (rings) of 4–6 flowers. The floral bracts are small, 3 × 2 mm, and drop soon after flowering. The corolla is 13–15 mm long, and the stamens protrude well beyond the flower tube. Flowering time is mid-summer to autumn (December to April). Fruit is a small, black nutlet. The fruits often ripen on the plant, nestled within each persistent calyx long after the flower has dried up and dropped off.","Syncolostemon canescens occurs from the Mahikeng region in the North West, across Limpopo and Gauteng to Mpumalanga and KwaZulu-Natal. It also occurs in northern Namibia, Botswana, Angola, Zimbabwe and Swaziland, and probably also in Mozambique. It grows among rocks in open woodland, marginal grassland and open places, and along watercourses in semi-arid woodland.

The name Syncolostemon is derived from the Greek words syn-, meaning ‘united’, kolos, ‘curtailed’ or ‘stunted, and stemon, ‘pillar’ or ‘stamen’, and refers to the lower pair of stamens that are typically fused and joined to the flower tube. This species is named for the grey hairs on the stems and leaves, and that give the plants a greyish look, canescens meaning ‘greyed’.

This species was previously classified in the genus Hemizygia which is no longer a recognised genus, because genetic analyses showed Hemizygia and Syncolostemon to be monophyletic (descended from the same common ancestor). Therefore, the 2 genera were merged under the older name, Syncolostemon, and all hemizygias are now Syncolostemon. The current description of S. canescens includes Hemizygia canescens and H. petrensis.","The soft herbaceous growth is killed by frost, but the woody base of the plant generally survives and it resprouts in the spring. It is similarly able to survive fast-moving grass fires.

The tubular flowers are pollinated by insects, probably by long-tongued flies.

 It is an attractive garden plant with strongly aromatic foliage, and can be used in potpourri.

Syncolostemon canescens needs a sunny or slightly shaded position. It can tolerate some wind, but generally prefers a more sheltered bed in the garden. It performs best in fertile, well-drained soil, with water during its spring and summer growing season, and performs well in the winter-rainfall region, as long as it is watered adequately in summer and does not get waterlogged in winter. Prune them back hard after flowering to keep them bushy and to promote flowering. Apply a compost mulch in spring to nourish the plant when it resprouts and give an application of 2:3:2 or similarly balanced fertilizer, during the summer.

It is well suited to grassland gardens and rockeries. Mass plant for best effect, and it works well as an edging plant. Also suitable for containers. For gardeners looking for aromatic and fragrant plants, it is a ‘must-have’ plant for its unusual fruity, coconut-scented, aromatic foliage. Syncolostemons are good filler plants in a colourful, mixed herbaceous bed, shown to best advantage if grouped in threes or fives and placed more to the centre of the bed so the plant’s front, can hide their woody bases. Both the sprigs of pink flowers and purpley bronze, add attractive detail to a border design.",,"During late summer, Syncolostemon canescens can be propagated by semi-hardwood cuttings. The soft, green spring growth should have started to turn a light brown colour, but not yet a dark brown and the stems will still able to bend slightly when tested, without snapping. The cutting taken should have a semi-soft greenish tip and a semi-hard light brown base — this balance between the 2 stages of maturity will ensure best success of rooting. Leave the growth tips intact and at least 2 nodes of leaves present, but strip off the foliage of the last 2 to 3 nodes. Dip the cut stem end into a rooting hormone, such as Seradix 2, and place in a suitable rooting medium that remains damp while draining freely and is able to hold the cutting upright. A mixture of finely milled bark and peat with river sand, usually works well. Rooting can take up to 8 weeks. Once there is a significant amount of root, pot up and keep in semi-shade until the plant shows new growth, then plant out once it has established itself in the bag. If you choose to wait until spring before planting out into the garden, be cautious to not overwater the plants in winter.

Seed collected from the plant after flowering and before pruning, can be kept through winter, then sown in spring into a sowing medium. As the seeds are quite small, cover them with only a thin layer of sowing medium and keep moist. Keep seed trays somewhere warm, but out of direct sunlight. Seed should germinate in 3–4 weeks. The seedlings can be potted up as soon as their first pair of true leaves are well developed. Grow on, and plant out into the garden once well established.",,#Fragrant,"It does not appear that Syncolostemon canescens is used in traditional medicine. It is an attractive garden plant with strongly aromatic foliage, and can be used in potpourri.

","Least Concern (LC). Syncolostemon canescens is not threatened.

Syncolostemon canescens is seldom troubled by any pests or diseases, most likely afforded natural protection by the strongly fragrant oils occurring in the plant’s leaves and stems.

Citrullus lanatus,Citrullus lanatus,,"Citrullus lanatus is a prostrate or climbing annual with several herbaceous, rather firm and stout stems up to 3 m long; the young parts are densely woolly with yellowish to brownish hairs while the older parts become hairless. The leaves are herbaceous but rigid, becoming rough on both sides; 60-200 mm long and 40-150 mm broad, ± ovate in outline, sometimes unlobed and ± entire, but usually deeply 3-lobed with the segments again lobed or doubly lobed; the central lobe is much the largest. The leaf stalks are somewhat hairy and up to 150 mm long. The tendrils are rather robust and usually divided in the upper part.","Both C. colocynthis and C. lanatus are mentioned in the Bible (Moldenke & Moldenke 1952).

The genus name Citrullus is the diminutive of Citrus and probably refers to the globose fruit. The specific epiphet lanatus refers to the dense woolly hairs on the young parts of the plant.

C. lanatus subsp. lanatus var. citroides : The fruit of this cultigen, known as the citron melon or in southern Africa as the makataan, is larger than the tsamma, also sweet and has a more or less concolorous rind and yellowish flesh. It is a traditional crop with several landraces in many parts of the world, e.g. Africa, the Mediterranean and Asia Minor, and introduced in the United States, Polynesia and Russia. The fruits are mostly used as fodder, but also for the production of citron peel or pectin. This plant also occurs as a weed in many countries.","Citrullus lanatus is a prostrate or climbing annual with several herbaceous, rather firm and stout stems up to 3 m long; the young parts are densely woolly with yellowish to brownish hairs while the older parts become hairless. The leaves are herbaceous but rigid, becoming rough on both sides; 60-200 mm long and 40-150 mm broad, ± ovate in outline, sometimes unlobed and ± entire, but usually deeply 3-lobed with the segments again lobed or doubly lobed; the central lobe is much the largest. The leaf stalks are somewhat hairy and up to 150 mm long. The tendrils are rather robust and usually divided in the upper part.

Male and female flowers occur on the same plant (monoecious) with the flower stalk up to 40 mm long and hairy. The receptacle is up to 4 mm long, broadly campanulate and hairy, the lobes are ± as long as the tube. The corolla is usually ± green or green-veined outside and white to pale or bright yellow inside and up to 30 mm in diameter. In southern Africa the flowering time of C. lanatus is mostly from January to April and the fruiting time mostly from February to May. Dry or rainy years will influence flowering and fruiting.

The fruit in the wild form is subglobose, indehiscent and up to 200 mm in diameter; the fruit stalk is up to 50 mm long. The fruits in the cultivated forms are globose to ellipsoid or oblong and up to 600 mm long and 300 mm in diameter. The rind in the ripe fruit is hairless and smooth, hard but not woody. In the wild forms the rind is pale or grey-green, usually mottled with irregular longitudinal bands of dark green or grey-green. In cultivated forms the rind is often concolorous yellowish to pale or dark green, or mottled with darker green, or marbled with a darker shade. The flesh in the wild form and some cultivated forms (citron watermelon) is firm and rather hard, white, green-white or yellowish. In cultivated forms the flesh is somewhat spongy in texture but very juicy and soft, pink to bright red-pink. The seeds are numerous, ± ovate in outline, sometimes bordered; in wild forms they are usually black or dark brown; in cultivated forms they are also white or mottled, mostly 6-12 mm long.

Citrullus lanatus can be recognized by its large fruit which is unique in the Cucurbitaceae of southern Africa and also by the dense yellowish to brownish hairs on the younger plant parts.

","This annual grows in grassland and bushland, mostly in sandy soils, often along water courses or near water. It has been collected at altitudes of 0-1785 m.

The genus Citrullus is restricted to Africa and parts of Asia and consists of four species, all diploid (2n=22).

","In southern Africa it has been cultivated since pre-colonial times with other crops such as sorghum and maize. The tender young leaves and fruits are cooked as green vegetables, while the fruit flesh may be cooked as porridge with maize meal. It is also a valuable stock feed, especially in times of drought. The makataan is an old favourite for making jam or preserve. The flesh from just below the rind is cut into squares and used to make what is called makataankonfyt . The fruit of the makataan can also be pickled.

C. lanatus subsp. lanatus var . caffer : The tsamma has a crisp, juicy, almost tasteless white flesh. It consists of more than 90% water and contains Vitamin C, ascorbic acid, some trace elements and very few calories. When the pulp is to be drunk, a hole is cut in one end of the fruit and the middle portion eaten. The remaining pulp is then mashed inside with a stick to a watery mass. The seeds are put aside for further use. The hollowed fruit can be used as a container for cooking or storing berries, etc. The pulp and seeds are prepared in a number of different ways for eating. The fruit minus the rind, is cut into slices for drying in the sun, or for mixing with meat, which is then stewed in a hollowed-out fruit. Roasting the entire fruit under a bed of hot coals in the sand adds a lot more flavour to the flesh. The flesh of the bitter karkoer or bitterboela is not used by humans, but the seeds may still be eaten. In the 19 th century Cape Colony the pickled young fruit of the karkoer was consumed; the fresh fruit pulp was used as a drastic purgative, a cathartic in dropsy and other complaints.

The flat brown seeds have a much higher food value than the flesh and have a nice nutty taste. Significant amounts of vitamin C, minerals, fat, starch and riboflavin have been obtained from them. They can be dried, roasted and eaten as such or ground into flour to make bread. The flour is said to contain saponin and is also used as a detergent. The seed contains a high percentage of oil which is similar to pumpkin seed oil and can be used in cooking. The seed oil has an anthelmintic action which is better than that of pumpkin seed oil.

Up to 40 melons have been recorded on one wild plant; their average mass was 1,3 kg. For some Bushmen and animals in the Kalahari, the melons are/were their only source of water for months in the dry season; it is/was not possible to live permanently in the Kalahari without it. In the old days it was almost impossible to travel in the Kalahari desert except during a good tsamma year. The fruit supplied food and water for oxen and even travellers. A person can survive for six weeks on an exclusive diet of tsamma.

Mature fruits of the cultivated watermelon can be stored for not more than four weeks. Mature fruits of the wild C. lanatus subsp. lanatus can remain intact and fleshy for over a year after abscission from the parent plant and they can be stored underground for long periods. H.B. Lecha and U. Posluszny reported on the `Comparative fruit morphology and anatomy in Citrullus lanatus ' at the conference of the South African Association of Botanists in 2001. A layer of wax covers the rind of both forms. However, in the cultivated watermelon, stomata occur on the surface of the rind. In contrast, the stomata in the wild fruit are sunken in depressions on the rind; these sunken stomata facilitate the development of stomatal wax plugs after fruit abscission. It was also found that the bands of sclereids comprising the rind tissue are more extensive, broader and more lignified in the wild watermelon than in the cultivated one.

C. lanatus subsp. mucosospermus : The fruit of this West African taxon is somewhat bitter, but the plant is often cultivated on a large scale mainly as cattle food and for the seed. The fruit pulp is eaten either raw or in soup, depending on the degree of sweetness or bitterness. The seed is sold in markets and used as a masticatory, medicine, food or source of oil for cooking and as an illuminant (it is a good substitute for cottonseed oil).

C. lanatus subsp. vulgaris : Cultivation of the watermelon as a fruit crop, began in ancient Egypt and Asia Minor and spread from there. The cultivars of this popular summer fruit grown today, bear little resemblance to their ancestral African forms. The fruit pulp, fruit juice and seed of the watermelon have all been credited with diuretic properties. A preparation of the seed can lower blood pressure. The juice of the root is said to be able to stop bleeding. In China the seeds are used in soups and snacks, in Eastern Europe excess fruits are made into syrup. The flesh is also an ingredient of sunlotions and other cosmetics.

This member of the Cucumber and Pumpkin Family is propagated by seed and grows easily. The wild forms are not commercially available and are not discussed in South African horticultural books. The tsamma, karkoer and makataan are rather regarded as curiosities and can only be grown in large gardens in fairly dry areas with enough space for the long prostrate stems.

Reader's Comment:

In October 2012 John Fry wrote:I live in Nothern Kwa Zulu. I have just finished reading an article on Citrullus lanatus, I have found it very interesting and would like to relate some information concerning this fruit. During 1892 my grandfather arrived from England aboard a sailing ship and many folk died on the trip over to South Africa of Scurvy. He smuggled himself aboard a sailing ship and whenhe was discovered he washed a shore atPort Natalwhere he was handed over to the British garrison. He was put into the army and served a period of time for his sentence. During this time he came aware, of the wild melonsgrowing in the Tugela valley, according to our records these fruit grew in there thousands in the Tugela valley.He then traded with the locals for these melons andtransported them back to Port Natalby ox wagon. The melons were then sold to those with sailing ships for food because of the threat of Scurvy. How he discovered that these melons had vitamin C I do not know. But what I do know that is where he started out on his way to success in this country.His name was the same as mine John Fry .

Rhoicissus tomentosa,Rhoicissus tomentosa,,"Usually a woody climber, or liane, with rope-like stems reaching the tops of 20 m high trees and looping from one to the other, occasionally forming a small tree 3-7 m in height. The bark is greyish and young branchlets are densely covered with thick, rusty hairs at first, becoming hairless with age. The tendrils are also velvety.

The leaves are simple and large, 90-200 x 70-160 mm, almost circular or wider than they are long, or kidney-shaped. The upper surface is deep green and hairless, whereas the under-surface is covered with soft, dense, rust-coloured hairs; occasionally these hairs are confined to the veins. The leaves are conspicuously 3-veined from the base.

The margin is sometimes entire but is usually shallowly toothed and slightly wavy, or conspicuously 3-lobed but not deeply divided. The petiole is velvety and up to 6 mm long. The young growth and new leaves are conspicuously covered in the velvety hairs and are richly coloured in shades of copper and purple. The old leaves turn crimson before falling.

The flowers are small, creamy green in colour and are clustered in dense heads on an approx. 20 mm long stalk. The buds are densely furry, covered with rust-coloured hairs. Flowering time is midsummer (Oct.-Jan.). The fruits look like grapes and grow in loose bunches; each one is an almost spherical, fleshy berry, up to 20 mm in diameter. They start out green but become red and then deep purplish black when fully ripe at the beginning of winter (May to June).

The fruits are edible and pleasant-tasting but acidic with whitish flesh that is similar to that of the cultivated grape. Inside each fruit are 1-3 smooth, pear-shaped seeds, approx. 6 x 8 mm.","The name Rhoicissus is derived from the Greek rhoia, meaning pomegranate and kissos, ivy. Perhaps not the most accurate of names: like ivy, it is a climber, but it has tendrils; and the small fruits, although spherical, do not seem very like that of a pomegranate. The Latin species name tomentosa means felt-like, with a dense woolly covering, and alludes to the rust-coloured hairs that cover the young growth, the underside of the leaves, buds and tendrils.

It has picked up an impressive number of common names, mostly regarding its resemblance to the cultivated grapevine, or its rope-like stems.

The grape family (Vitaceae) is a large, with approximately 1000 species spread throughout the warm countries of the world and is famous for its most celebrated member, the grapevine, Vitis vinifera. In southern Africa this family is represented by five genera (Ampelocisssus, Cayratia, Cissus, Cypostemma and Rhoicissus) and 53 species.","This wild grape occurs from the Cape Peninsula, where it is abundant in the kloofs of the eastern slopes of Table Mountain, and along the coastline in a narrow strip all the way through the Eastern Cape up to northern KwaZulu-Natal and then inland through Mpumalanga into Limpopo Province, Zimbabwe and Malawi. It is almost always associated with forest and grows in riverine fringes where it clambers over trees and bushes.

In southern Africa, the genus Rhoicissus is represented by 10 species that occur in all the provinces of South Africa except the Northern Cape and all other southern African countries except Namibia and Botswana.

Rhoicissus tomentosa is relatively easy to tell apart from the others because it and only three of the other southern African species have simple or shallowly lobed leaves and it is the only canopy climber among them.

Other SA Rhoicissus species The other three with simple leaves are:-

All the other species are distinctly 3- to 5-foliolate and can be distinguished by the presence or absence of marginal teeth. Those with toothed margins are R. sekhukhuniensis (Sekhukhune grape), R. rhomboidea (glossy wild grape), R. tridentata (Bushman's grape) and R. sessifolia, and those whose margin is entire are R. revoilii (bushveld grape) and R. digitata (baboon grape). Species with toothed margins:

The species with entire margins can be told apart by R. revoilii being 3-foliolate and the leaflet apex mostly tapering to a point, whereas R. digitata has some 5-foliolate leaves, although most are 3-foliolate and the leaflet apex is tapering to rounded and is usually notched. Further, each leaflet of R. revoilii has an approx. 20 mm long stalk whereas those of R. digitata do not, and the base of the lateral leaflets of R. revoilii are often markedly asymmetric and tendrils are seldom present but are frequently present on R. digitata. Species with entire margins:

At Kirstenbosch we have Rhoicissus tomentosa, R. rhomboidea and R. digitata growing in the garden.

",,#Fragrant,"The fruits are eaten by birds and mammals and the leaves are browsed by game. The fruits are said to be particularly popular with Knysna and Purple-crested louries. The swollen tubers, although toxic, are eaten by bushpig and porcupines. Silver Striped Hawkmoth caterpillars (Hippotion celerio) have been recorded eating the leaves of Rhoicissus tomentosa and R. tridentata.

The leaves exhibit the phenomenon of guttation very well, when glistening drops of clear, watery fluid collect on the margins. This is best seen in early morning after humid windless nights. These drops of moisture are not dew (which is water that has condensed from the atmosphere onto the plant surfaces), but are drops of liquid forced out of the plant.

When soil moisture is high and atmospheric conditions are not good for transpiration (evaporation of water via the leaves) root pressure builds up and the plant cannot rid itself of water fast enough so the liquid is pushed out of the tips of the veins in the leaves.

Rhoicissus tomentosa is one of the best wild grapes, the fruits are edible and pleasant tasting but acidic. They are thought to have caused severe colic and diarrhoea in three children in Grahamstown, so should be eaten in moderation. The juicy, pulpy ripe fruits boiled with plenty of sugar (7 grapes to 30 g sugar) make a brilliantly coloured and delicious jam or jelly.

A reasonable wine can also be made from the fruits, described as sour with a pleasant fragrance. The fruits are also used to make vinegar.

The pliant branches are split and used as rope for tying down thatch and also in basket-making. Because of its close relationship to the vines of cultivation, it was tried out as stock for grafting in combating phylloxera in Cape vineyards in the 1800s but was not used, as its growth is much too slow.

The tuberous rootstock is poisonous and is used in traditional medicine The roots boiled in milk are given to calves to expel intestinal worms. They may also be used during pregnancy to facilitate delivery, although R. tridentata is the more commonly used species for that remedy.

This vigorous, scrambling, evergreen climber is a good garden subject. It is easy to grow and has ornamental foliage, both in shape and colour, giving interest throughout the year. It can be used in place of ivy (Hedera helix) or Virginia creeper/Boston ivy (Parthenocissus quinquefolia) to cover a wall, but being a tendril climber it needs something, like a trellis, to hang on to.

It can be grown over a fence to form a screen, or over a pergola or a trellis. It is an attractive groundcover in semi-shade or shade, or it can be allowed to form a large mounding shrub in the open.

It is also a good hanging basket subject. It can be used to mimic topiary-take a topiary shape, fill it with soil using something to keep the soil inside, like you would a hanging basket, or use sphagnum moss but make sure it never dries out, punch holes in the netting and insert rooted Rhoicissus tomentosa cuttings. As it grows, weave the shoots through the netting or the wire pieces that make up the shape.

Being accustomed to life on the forest edge or forest floor, it grows in low light and can be grown indoors.

Rhoicissus tomentosa can be propagated by seed, sown in spring-summer, or by stem cuttings taken in spring-summer, or by layering done in spring-summer.",The tuberous rootstock is poisonous and is used in traditional medicine,,,,

This moss is found in forests, along streams, in open grassland, on roadsides, and at the base of walls. The substrates include rocks (granite, ironstone, dolerite, sandstone), concrete, soil, humus, tree bark, tree root and decaying logs. The plant prefers well drained, moist, damp or semi-dry situations in full sun, shade or partial shade at 250-3100 m above sea level.

There are 15 species of Haplocladium (including H. angustifolium) that are widespread in tropical and temperate regions of the world. Another common species is H. microphyllum (Hedw.) Broth. which is widespread in neotropical montane and subtemperate regions in Europe and Asia. H. angustifolium is the only species of the genus known from southern Africa.

H. angustifolium occasionally grows in association with other plant species including species of Albizia, Buddleja, Salix, Podocarpus, Fabronia, Entodon, Fissidens, Rhynchostegium, Bryum, as well as Leucosidea sericea, Neckera valentiniana, Pelekium versicolor and Racopilum capense.

There are currently no recorded uses of H. angustifolium for southern Africa but a species of the same genus, H. microphyllum, is used medicinally for tonsillitis, bronchitis, tympanitis and cystitis in China (Glime & Saxena 1991).

Sparrmannia africana,Sparrmannia africana,,"Sparrmannia africana is a large, much branched, bushy soft-wooded evergreen shrub or tree with a rounded habit, usually up to around 4 m but it can reach up to 8 m. The branches are soft, and young branches are covered in stiff, bristly hairs. The leaves are large, up to 270 x 210 mm or more, heart-shaped, with 3, 5, 7 or 9 veins from the base. The margin is toothed. The leaves often have 3, 5, 7 or 9 lobes but are usually entire near the inflorescence. The leaves are softly textured, covered in short, bristly hairs on both sides.
","The genus Sparrmannia is named in honour of Anders Sparrmann (1748-1820) (sometimes rendered as Andrew or Andreas), Swedish botanist and physician, and pupil of Linnaeus. He was ship's surgeon to Capt. Ekeberg who brought him to Cape Town in 1772. He accompanied Capt. Cook on his second great voyage, 1772-75, returned to Cape Town in 1775 and undertook a journey into the interior of South Africa - travelling as far as the Somerset East area in the Eastern Cape, which is when he must have collected this species - returning to Sweden in 1776.

Sparrmann was the first botanist to collect Sparrmannia africana and introduced it to European horticulture in about 1778 where it was commonly cultivated in conservatories at that time. This species is named for its place of origin, Africa, africana meaning of or from Africa in Latin.","The flowers are white with a mass of yellow and red-purple stamens in the centre, produced in 10-20-flowered umbels towards the ends of the branches. In bud, the flowers are white to greenish white and drooping, and the outer surface of the sepals and the pedicels (flower stalks) are covered in short bristly hairs. The pedicel lifts up to about 45° as the flower opens to release white petals that open wide and then reflex fully, exposing the central mass of stamens. When spent, the petals and sepals close up again and by now the pedicel is standing straight up.

Much of the attraction of this flower is in the puff of brightly bicoloured stamens. Many free stamens form the central mass but not all of them are fertile. The outer stamens are yellow with purple tips and are sterile, while the inner ones, stained reddish-purple with purple tips, are fertile. The filaments are about 10 mm long and are moniliform in the upper half, meaning that they are regularly constricted resulting in bumps or knobs, like a string of beads or a knotted rope. They are also sensitive to touch (see Ecology). Flowering occurs from mid-winter into early summer (June to November).

Capsules and seeds

The fruit is a rounded capsule, about 20 mm in diameter, covered in spiny bristles, that splits open when ripe (dehiscent) to release 3 x 2 mm brown seeds with a finely wrinkled (rugulose) seed coat.

Sparrmannia africana grows in damp places on forest margins, hill slopes, in ravines, on rocky hillsides and along streams along the southern coast from Riversdale in the Western Cape to Port Elizabeth in the Eastern Cape. It is common in the districts of George, Knysna, Uniondale and Humansdsorp.","The Malvaceae is a family of about 243 genera and 4225 species, with 31 genera and 401 species native to southern Africa, as well as 8 genera and 20 exotic species that have naturalised. Sparrmannia was previously placed in Tiliaceae, the Jute & Linden family. Today Tiliaceae, Bombacaceae (Bombax, Kapok & Baobab family), Sterculiaceae (Sterculia family) and Malvaceae are all regarded as part of a single family, Malvaceae.

Sparrmannia is a small genus of about seven species native to Africa and Madagascar, with only two species native to southern Africa. The other southern African species is S. ricinocarpa , which is a slender shrub or straggling scrambler found at forest edges or in forest clearings in the Eastern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal, Free State, Lesotho, Gauteng, Mpumalanga and Swaziland into tropical Africa.

The confusion regarding the spelling, Sparmannia vs. Sparrmannia, can be traced back to Carl Linnaeus the younger (L.f.), the son of Carl Linnaeus. In 1782 when he published the name and description of this genus, he misspelled the genus name with one R but in the species description he spelled it correctly with two Rs. Both names were in use, as different botanists adopted one or the other spelling, until 1989 when Codd and Nicolas proposed that Sparrmannia be conserved, as it was clearly Linnaeus's intention to spell it that way, after Anders Sparrmann, and that his use of Sparmannia was an orthographic error.

The stamens are sensitive to touch. When an insect, or a finger, bumps or brushes the flower the mass of stamens puffs out even further. One can watch as the mass opens itself out, rather like watching a hairy caterpillar puff itself up when threatened. The scientific term for this is haptonasty. In this case it is thought that the movement aids pollination by pushing pollen out and onto the visitor's body.

The knobs on the filaments are thought to mimic 'feeding anthers', and when visitors try to exploit them, they come into contact with the fertile stamens and stigma and effect pollination. Feeding anthers is the term used for the anthers of plants that offer up their anthers or parts of them as bait to pollinating insects, so that visitors eat them and take up and move the pollen incidentally as they are feeding.

According to Mabberley (2008), the reflexed petals of the flower keep the stamens and anthers dry during rain. The cupped petals fill up with water and it overflows gently, a drop at a time.

The timber is soft and spongy and of little value, but the plant yields a good fibre. In 1886 an attempt was made for a few years by the Kama Fibre Syndicate to commercially exploit the fibre at Storms River. It was sold under the name African Hemp. In 1908 and 1919 the Imperial Institute in London investigated the fibre, and found it was inferior to Indian jute; too brittle for the manufacture of rope and twine, and too harsh for mixing with jute.

It is a popular house plant in Europe, where it is known as African Hemp, African Linden or House Lime.

","Grow Sparrmannia africana in half-day shade, semi-shade, dappled shade or light shade. It will grow in a sunny position but this plant prefers a bit of shade. It is not fussy about soils but grows better in well-drained, fertile, well-composted soils. Add compost when planting and lay a generous mulch of compost at least once a year. It is better in a well ventilated position, because free air circulation reduces attacks by fungi on the leaves.

However it is not suited to an exposed position that receives strong wind, especially sustained strong wind like Cape Town's South-Easter. It needs protection from frost, although it will survive and resprout if cut down by light frost. Water well, especially when young, thereafter water moderately. Yellowing of the leaves indicates drought stress. Prune to shape. If left unpruned it can become leggy. Prune back hard once a year, in spring, to encourage a dense, bushy habit.

Sparrmannia africana brings a lush, leafy look to the garden, and is ideal for the shade garden, shady courtyards, the south side of the house that does not see much sun, or use it to screen a shady boundary wall. It is fast growing, and a useful plant to fill an empty space, fast.

Sparrmannia africana does well in pots and can be grown indoors where it needs a well ventilated position in bright light but not direct sun. Water well in summer. Feed generously or repot every year with fresh, composted soil.

Sparrmannia africana is easy to propagate from seed or cuttings. Sow seed in spring or early summer, use a general mix suitable for seedlings and keep warm and moist. Take semi-hardwood or hardwood cuttings in spring or summer, remove at least a third of the leaves and treat with a suitable rooting hormone. At Kirstenbosch we have found that the leaves rot off very quickly if they get too wet. Thus, when cuttings are placed in the mist unit with bottom-heated benches, the misters are reduced to an 8 second burst every 10-12 minutes. Alternatively, the cuttings can be rooted in a cold frame.",,#Fragrant,"Sparrmannia africana is fast and easy to grow. It is well known in cultivation, better known as a house plant in Europe and the USA, than as a garden plant at home.","Least Concern. Sparrmannia africana is not threatened.

Some people report minor skin irritation when handling the hairy leaves.",,,,
Merwilla plumbea,Merwilla plumbea,,"It is a variable species, with individuals and populations of differing bulb size, flower colour, leaf coloration etc. In general it produces a large bulb, 10 to 15 cm in diameter, covered with firm, hardened, papery brown or purplish tunics (bulb scales). It is deciduous, growing during summer and dormant in the winter.


Merwilla plumbea belongs in the family Hyacinthaceae (hyacinth family), formerly part of the Liliaceae (lily family), a family of perennial bulbous herbs consisting of ±46 genera and ±900 species found in Africa, Eurasia and North America but most richly represented in southern Africa and in the Mediterranean region to south west Asia. Other noteworthy southern African members of this family include Veltheimia bracteata, Lachenalia mathewsii, Eucomis species (pineapple lilies) and Ornithogalum species (chinkerinchees) while species more familiar to northern hemisphere gardeners include the hyacinth, Hyacinthus orientalis and the bluebell, Hyacinthoides non-scripta.

","This genus has been named after F van der Merwe, a botanist who worked on this family. The species name refers to the lead blue colour of the flowers.

The Afrikaans name blouberglelie, which means blue mountain lily, is also applied to other South African species of Scilla and is a name that has been in use for hundreds of years. It earned the name blouslangkop, which means blue snake's head, presumably because the emerging flower stalk resembles a snake, and the tips of the flower stalks are often coloured bluish-purple. The Zulu name inguduza means ""searching the body for the cause of the ailment"", indicating its use in KwaZulu-Natal as a diagnostic tool.

Merwilla plumbea belongs in the family Hyacinthaceae (hyacinth family). It was previously called Scilla natalensis.
","A rosette of 6 to 9 broad, tapering leaves emerges from the top of the bulb in spring. The leaves are attractive in their own right, with clearly distinct veins which give them a two-tone effect, particularly when back-lit. Their colour is light green with white-grey overtones, they can be entirely green, or they can have purplish colouring on the margins, at the base or at the apex of the leaf, or the underside can be partially or entirely shaded with purple. They can be completely hairless, or one or both sides can be covered in short hairs. The leaves of a well-grown plant can reach a height of 30 to 50 cm with about equal spread.

The inflorescence is a many-flowered slender raceme of bright violet-blue, or pale blue, or blue and white, star-shaped flowers each one carried on a delicate amethyst blue stalk, giving the overall effect of a misty blue plume floating in mid-air. There is also a white form, although we don't have specimens in the Garden as yet. The flower stalks are produced either just before or with the new leaves in spring to early summer (October), and are usually about 1 m tall, although some are as short as 0.75 m and a few can reach a height of about 1.4 m. The flowers have a honey-like scent towards evening and are visited by bees during the day. The seed, which is formed in capsules that split when mature, does not look much like seed. It is beige in colour, somewhat irregular in shape and a bit wrinkled, 6 mm long x 2-3mm wide tapering to a point. It is light in weight and dispersed by the wind. It does not last long unless it is refrigerated (not frozen) where it will last for a number of years.

Merwilla plumbea occurs on the east of southern Africa, throughout the Eastern Cape, Lesotho, KwaZulu-Natal, Free State, Swaziland and into Mpumalanga where it is found growing in a variety of habitats from sunny slopes, rocky hills, cliffs and ledges, to damp cliff faces, near waterfalls, in moist depressions, on the edges of streams and vleis (wetlands) to coastal areas, in groups or as solitary specimens.",,"They are relatively drought tolerant, but to grow well they require ample water in summer. As the leaves start to yellow in late summer to autumn, water can be withheld. It is best to keep them dry during winter, but they are undamaged by the wet Cape Town winters provided the soil is well-drained or they are growing on sloping ground. Merwilla plumbea can be considered frost hardy to zone 9 (-7 °C / 20 °F) but in severely cold climates it is probably best grown in containers which can be taken indoors during winter, or grown in a glasshouse.

Propagation is by seed or division of offsets. Seed germinates readily, but it must be noted that it does not last long unless it is refrigerated. It can be sown immediately after harvest in summer, or the previous season's refrigerated seed can be sown in spring or summer. Germination occurs within 7 days and the plants should flower in their third or fourth year. Again it is recommended that the young plants be disturbed as little as possible in order to get them to flower as soon as possible, so sow the seed thinly in deep (minimum 10cm) trays or pots, or transplant them into larger individual pots/bags after thinning the seed trays, or during their second season.

Offsets (daughter bulbs) are produced at the base of a mature bulb and can be removed and replanted during the dormant period. If left undisturbed a single plant will in time become a clump of plants which can be lifted and divided during the dormant period, or the outer ones can be detached without lifting the entire clump. When dividing two bulbs it may be necessary to cut them apart. Dust the cut surface with a fungicide and store for at least 2-3 weeks in a cool dry spot to allow a seal to form over the wound. The divided bulbs can then be planted as described earlier.",,#Fragrant,"The bulb is used medicinally in South Africa and is one of the most popularly traded muthi (meaning traditional medicine and pronounced moo-tea) items in KwaZulu-Natal. Warmed fresh bulb scales, slightly burned bulb scales and decoctions of the bulb are used externally as ointments for wound-healing, to treat sprains, fractures, boils and sores and to draw abscesses. The ash from a burnt plant, and the bulb in powdered form, is rubbed into cuts and scratches, and over sprains and fractures. Decoctions are taken as enemas for female infertility and to enhance male potency and libido. It is also known to be used as a purgative, a laxative and for internal tumours, and is used in conjunction with other ingredients in infusions taken during pregnancy to facilitate delivery and in treatments for chest pain and kidney troubles. It is also an ingredient in a medicinal preparation for cattle suffering from lung sickness. It has magical properties for the Tswana who rub the powdered bulb into the back, joints and other body parts to increase their strength and resistance to witchcraft. The plant appears to have significant analgesic and antimicrobial activity, and phytochemical studies have found that it contains compounds known to possess anti-inflammatory and anti-mutagenic properties which would support its use for the treatment of strains, sprains and cancers. Although its effect on sheep appears similar to that caused by cardiac glycoside poisoning, whether or not it contains the same heart glycosides found in the closely related genera of Drimia and Urginea remains to be determined.","Its Red Data conservation status has recently been upgraded from Insufficiently Known to Vulnerable due to its being a very popular item in the KwaZulu-Natal muthi trade. Intensive harvesting is causing a decline in wild populations over an ever-increasing area of its distribution range.

Merwilla plumbea has shown itself to be selectively toxic to mammals. It is said to be poisonous to stock, particularly when the young leaves appear in spring. Experiments on sheep, using fresh bulb as a drench, proved fatal to the sheep, yet it has been proven an ineffective rat poison. It is apparently toxic to man when raw, even the sap is reported to burn the skin, and for any preparations taken internally the plant must first be heated. This plant should be treated with extreme caution, as taking any part of it internally is potentially fatal.",,,,
Tarchonanthus littoralis,Tarchonanthus littoralis,"Both the leaves and the wood have a strong smell of camphor, hence its common name.","Tarchonanthus littoralis is a large, dense, bushy shrub or small, shapely tree, 1-8 m tall. The trunks are often crooked, and the trees often multi-stemmed. The bark is vertically fissured and cracked, flaking off in narrow strips. Young growth is densely hairy. Leaves are strongly aromatic and leathery. The colour of the upper and lower surfaces of the leaves are distinctly different: the upper surface is dark green, hairy when young but becoming hairless; the lower surface is white-grey and covered in a dense mat of velvety hairs. The main vein is sunken, particularly in the lower half and the leaf contains a fine network of veins, which is clearly visible on both surfaces. The margin is very often faintly and minutely toothed in the upper part (on the Kirstenbosch plants, this is most easily seen on the young coppice growth).","There are two possible explanations for the name Tarchonanthus : one, that it is based on the Arabic name tarchon for tarragon, Artemisia dracunculus, and the Greek, anthos, meaning flower, alluding to the similarity of the flower heads of the two species; the other, that it is from the Greek, tarchos, meaning funeral rites, perhaps due to the camphor scent of the leaves. The species name littoralis is from the Latin litoralis and means of the shore, seashore or coast, alluding to its coastal habitat. Both the leaves and the wood have a strong smell of camphor, hence its common name.","Tarchonanthus littoralis is dioecious, meaning that the male and female flowers are carried on different trees. Peak flowering time is during mid to late summer (December-March). On both male and female trees, the individual flowers are borne in small flower heads which are grouped into large, branched, terminal inflorescences. Male flower heads are 5-10 mm in diameter and contain 13-47 flowers, each tiny flower a 5-lobed, funnel-shaped tube, ± 3 mm long, with recurved corolla lobes. The anthers are ± 1.5 mm long and protrude beyond the tube. The male flowers have a sterile ovary and a long, protruding style (up to 8 mm), which is a noticeable feature of the flowers. The anthers are the striped structures surrounding the base of the style.

The female flower heads are ± 5 mm in diameter and are made up of only 3-6 tiny flowers. Each flower is a 5-lobed, funnel-shaped, ± 2 mm long tube with recurved corolla lobes. The style is ± 3 mm long with 2 short branches, and protrudes beyond the corolla lobes. The fruit is an achene, ± 4 mm long and is densely covered in white, woolly hairs.

Both the male and female flowers are white to cream-coloured but the bracts that surround the flowers and the stalks are creamy brown and so the overall colour of the inflorescence is a yellowish cream and the trees are attractive while in flower. A month or so after flowering, each female flower has become a cotton-wool-like ball of shiny white fragrant hairs, that fluffs out more as it matures. The small seed is buried inside the puff of white hairs. The brown star in amongst the woolly hairs is the remains of the corolla tube and style. The white fruiting inflorescences are extremely showy against the dark green foliage, and remain decorative for many months. While the female trees are still looking beautiful, the male flowers are dead and brown and the male trees are quite drab in comparison.

Tarchonanthus littoralis occurs from the Cape Peninsula in the Western Cape, along the coast, on hillsides, dunes and river banks, through the Eastern Cape to KwaZulu-Natal.

Tarchonanthus belongs in the daisy family. It is a small genus of a few species that occurs in tropical and southern Africa. Until recently, only two species were recognized in southern Africa: Tarchonanthus camphoratus and T. trilobus, but P.P.J. Herman (2002) of the National Herbarium in Pretoria, after studying the herbarium material, found that five distinct species had been grouped under T. camphoratus, and today we recognize six southern African species of Tarchonanthus.

Herman's 2002 revision of the Tarchonanthus camphoratus complex is based on differences in inflorescences, flowering times, leaf shape, leaf margin and distribution. The five species that were all once lumped together under T. camphoratus are now recognized as follows:

T. camphoratus, camphor bush, is widely distributed in a variety of habitats in the northern part of southern Africa from Namibia, Botswana, Limpopo, North-West, Gauteng, Free State and Northern Cape as well as in tropical and north Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It has narrowly elliptic to slightly oblanceolate, grey-green to khaki green leaves with an entire margin, 26-80 x 7-20 mm, and the cottony hairs that envelop the seed are yellowish or cream-coloured. It flowers in autumn to winter, and it is not browsed by stock except as a last resort.

T. minor, small-leaf camphor bush, occurs in the Free State, Lesotho, Northern Cape and inland in the Western and Eastern Cape. It has very small, narrowly elliptic leaves, 10-40 x 2.5-15.0 mm, flower heads in dense clusters, and the cottony hairs that envelop the seed are white. It flowers in spring to early summer.

T. obovatus, Gordonia camphor bush, is restricted to the Northern Cape. It has small, obovate or elliptic, entire leaves, 12-32 x 7-17 mm, and the cottony hairs that envelop the seed are pure white. It flowers in autumn to early winter and it is readily browsed by game and domestic stock.

T. parvicapitulatus, small-headed camphor bush, occurs in Limpopo, Swaziland, KwaZulu-Natal, Eastern Cape and in Zimbabwe. It has small, oblanceolate leaves, 25-60 x 7-16 mm, with faintly denticulate margins in the upper part, and the cottony hairs that envelop the seed are white. It flowers in autumn to winter.

T. littoralis, coastal camphor bush, is most easily distinguished from the others by its much larger, oblanceolate, elliptic to narrowly elliptic leaves, 40-140 x 10-45 mm, and large fruiting heads.

Tarchonanthus littoralis is pollinated by insects. The fruits are encased in light, cottony hairs and are dispersed by wind. The cottony hairs make the seeds buoyant, which allows them to float for some time. This would enable seeds from plants growing along the coast or beside rivers that fall in the water, to be washed ashore again and to find a suitable place to lodge and germinate, instead of sinking, germinating and dying under water. The cottony hairs may also assist the seed in finding suitable sites to germinate by sticking to wet soil when it happens to land on wet soil.

Tarchonanthus littoralis, if cut down or burned but not killed by a fire, will resprout from the base.

",,"Tarchonanthus littoralis is a quick-growing, small, dense tree. It has the ability to survive and thrive under harsh conditions that many other plants cannot tolerate. It can be planted to provide a windbreak, as a pioneer in a new garden to provide shade, and to bind the sand. Tarchonanthus littoralis also has excellent proportions for small suburban gardens, never getting too big, with a decorative trunk and shapely crown. It grows right beside the sea and tolerates salt spray, which makes it tailor-made for coastal gardens. It is ideal for difficult sites on the Cape Flats where it thrives in the nutrient-poor sandy soils, strong wind and summer drought. It is water-wise and can be planted in dry areas or in gardens that are not irrigated. It also does not mind being pampered in the average suburban garden.

Plant in well-drained soil in a sunny position. Give it a good start with plenty of compost and water in its first few years. Once established, it requires very little attention. Prune to shape when young or keep tidy as it matures, and remove unwanted shoots from the base to keep the trunk clear.

Gardeners looking for a female plant for the decorative fruiting heads, should either buy a plant bearing fruit, or learn to tell the difference between the male and female flowers. To achieve pollination and viable seeds, one must plant a male and a female tree.

Tarchonanthus littoralis can be propagated by seed or cuttings.

Seed is best sown when ripe in late summer to autumn or stored dry and cool and sown in spring to early summer. Seed is ripe when the fruits detach easily from the inflorescence, either by gently pulling or knocking them off. The seeds in their cotton balls can also be picked up from under the tree. It is virtually impossible to remove the seeds from their woolly covering and they can be sown with hairs still attached. Use a well-drained medium, sow the seeds thickly in a single layer and cover them lightly to stop them from blowing away. Germination takes 4-6 weeks with a 70-80 % success rate. Seedlings can be transplanted as soon as they are strong enough to handle.

Take semi-hardwood cuttings in early summer, treat with a rooting hormone and place under the mist with bottom heat. Tarchonanthus littoralis takes a while to root and on average only half of the cuttings taken will root.",,#Fragrant,"Tarchonanthus littoralis is important in binding sand on coastal dunes. It is a valuable source of food for wild animals and domestic stock.

The five species that made up the Tarchonanthus camphoratus complex are widely used in traditional medicine. The leaves and twigs are used, either drunk in a tea or chewed fresh, to treat headaches, asthma, bronchitis, coughs, colds, flu and other chest ailments, rheumatism, internal bleeding, anxiety, indigestion, heartburn and other stomach troubles, and to relieve toothache. An ointment made with the leaves is used to soothe chilblains and sore feet and sometimes used to massage the legs before a long journey. In combination with wild sages, the Khoisan people used them to treat fevers and measles.

The Khoisan people used to smoke the leaves as a dagga substitute (hemp, marijuana). The leaves are tied into hair to perfume the hair or rubbed into the scalp to keep the hair free of nits and dandruff or just for the perfume. Leaves and twigs are used as an insect repellent among clothing and linen. The fragrant, cottony seed heads are used to stuff cushions and pillows, which are said to be excellent for headaches and sleeplessness. Leaves tucked under the pillow are said to ensure a peaceful night. The wood burns, even when green, giving off a perfumed smoke. Burned leaves and seeds also give off perfumed smoke and are used to fumigate huts, and smoke is inhaled to treat rheumatism, headaches and sleeplessness.

The wood is heavy and fairly hard, tough and termite-proof but is difficult to season and chop. It polishes well and has been used for musical instruments, cabinet work and is suitable for turnery. It is used for boat-building and to make yokes and yoke pins. It has also been used for the shafts of spears and bows, and for walking sticks. It makes a durable fence pole, said to stand for 30 years. The wood is said to be poisonous and capable of causing a septic sore on the skin that heals with difficulty.

In Griqualand West, the old tradition was to surround the homestead with an outer fence made of thickly woven camphor bush sticks.

In the modern home, its long straight coppice growth can be cut and used as sturdy garden stakes. Its leaves and seed heads can be used in potpourri or to perfume clothing or linen cupboards.",Tarchonanthus littoralis is not threatened.,,,,
Nymphaea nouchali var. caerulea,Nymphaea nouchali var. caerulea,,"It is a clump-forming perennial with thick black spongy tuberous rhizomes anchored in the pond mud by spreading roots. The water lily does not have true stems: the leaves are on long petioles (leaf stalks) that arise directly from the rhizome. The leaves are large and flat, rounded or oval in shape with notched margins, up to 40 cm in diameter, and cleft almost to the centre where the petiole is attached. They are relatively short-lived and are replaced regularly throughout the growing season. They start out as a soft shiny green at the centre of the plant. As they age, the petiole lengthens, pushing the leaf towards the outer perimeter making room for the new growth, and they develop light brown or purple splashes which eventually cover the leaf, leaving only the veins green. They then start to die, turning yellow then brown and eventually disappearing under the water. One plant can spread over an area of about 1 metre.

The large, elegant blue flowers are held well above the water at the tip of a sturdy green stalk and appear almost constantly from spring until the end of summer (September to February). They are bisexual, star-like and regular (actinomorphic), with 4 sepals, green on the outside and white to blue on the inside, and many blue petals. In the centre of the flower are numerous blue-tipped bright golden yellow stamens. There are colour forms other than blue that occasionally occur, e.g. white, mauve and pink, but blue is the most common and the water lilies at Kirstenbosch are blue. The flowers open in early to mid-morning and close completely in late afternoon and stay closed all night. The opening and closing mechanism of the flowers is controlled by the sepals. If they are removed, the flower loses the ability to close. A fully open flower measures 15-20 cm across and each flower lasts for about four days. The flowers are sweetly fragrant and are visited constantly by bees who are the most likely pollinator.

","In Africa, Nymphaea nouchali occurs in tropical to southern Africa where it is common (although not as common as it used to be) in pools, dams, vleis and swamps, seasonal ponds, lake edges and slow-flowing streams and rivers, mostly in water 30 to 90 cm deep.

In modern times, the name lotus is used almost exclusively for Nelumbo nucifera, also called the sacred lotus or incorrectly the Egyptian lotus. Nelumbo nucifera is not a native of Egypt. It actually comes from south-east Asia where it is often found near temples and is regarded as sacred in China and Japan. It was introduced to the Nile by the Romans, probably for food. The true Egyptian lotus is Nymphaea nouchali var. caerulea (syn. N. caerulea) and Nymphaea lotus.

The common name kaaimanblom, which means merman's flower in English, was acquired because this water lily is often found growing in a deep pool (kaaimansgat), and popular superstition had it that a merman (kaaiman) dwelt in such a pool and would drown anyone swimming in his pool. Furthermore, it was suspected that the merman put the flowers there specifically to attract his victims, especially disobedient boys. It gets the name frog's pulpit / paddapreekstoel, because the leaves provide resting places for frogs.

The leaves of show many interesting adaptations to their watery environment. The margins are slightly rolled inwards toward the uppermost side (involute) which helps keep the blades afloat. The underside of the leaf, which is continually wet, has a strong attraction to the water and this holds the leaf flat against the water. The veins act like a structural support for the leaves. The upper leaf surface is coated with a smooth waxy cuticle, which gives it the appearance of being leathery and shiny. This water-repellent waxy layer is of vital importance to the plant, not only to help prevent the leaf from sinking, but also to prevent the tiny stomatal pores, through which it breathes, from becoming clogged with dust. When water splashes onto the leaf surface, it forms rounded droplets that roll across the surface cleaning up the dust as they go. Clean dust-free leaves are also better able to photosynthesise effectively.

Another problem facing aquatic plants is the supply of oxygen to their roots. Roots must constantly be supplied with oxygen to stay healthy and the water lily's roots are buried in poorly aerated pond mud and therefore cannot get oxygen they way normal plants do. It has overcome this difficulty by developing a system of large internal ducts throughout the leaves, petioles and roots which ferries the oxygen from the leaves to the roots.

The famous night-flowering giant water lily of the Amazon, Victoria amazonica has a complicated pollination mechanism where beetles are trapped inside the closed flower where they are given a meal in exchange for getting covered by pollen. When they are released, laden with pollen they head straight for the newly opened fresh flowers of neighbouring plants. It does not appear that the nymphaeas employ such a complicated strategy. The spent, pollinated flower closes completely, looking like a bud, enclosed once again by the sepals. It sinks underwater where the ovary develops into a hard green berry-like ovate to pear-shaped fruit. In clean water they can be clearly seen resting on the pond floor. When mature, the walls decay to release thousands of small (1.2 x 0.8 mm) ellipsoidal seeds, each surrounded by a membranous aril which causes them to float for a while, allowing the seeds to disperse from the parent plant, before it disintegrates and they sink under the water onto the mud.

","There are five African varieties:

The water lily family, Nymphaeaceae, is an old and evolutionarily primitive one, and is grouped with buttercups (Ranunculus) and magnolias in the order Ranales. Furthermore, fossil evidence suggests that nymphaeas have not changed much over the past 160 million years. All they have done is move about the globe, keeping in the tropical and temperate zones. Another well known genus in this family is Victoria, the giant amazon water lily.

The genus Nymphaea consists of roughly 40 species found in tropical and temperate climates of both hemispheres. It is full of synonymy, because different populations or colour forms have been described as separate species which have since been sunk into one species and in some cases the same plants have been described as different species by different botanists, or the name of one species has been misapplied to another species. It all gets rather confusing. There are also many variants and hundreds of hybrids that come in all colours, shapes and sizes.

There are only two species that occur in southern Africa.

Water lilies, particularly nymphaeas, the true water lilies, are steeped in history and tradition. The name of the genus Nymphaea is a direct transliteration of a Greek word which Theophrastus (a disciple of Plato and Aristotle) used to describe these plants about 300 years before the common era, and refers to the practice of early Greeks in dedicating the water lily to the semi-divine water maidens, the nymphs. This is however by no means the earliest record that we have of the water lily. In Egypt, Nymphaea caerulea (now sunk in Nymphaea nouchali var. caerulea), the blue lotus and Nymphaea lotus, the white lotus, have been admired, painted, eaten, grown and revered for thousands of years. The goddess Isis is said to have pointed out that the rhizomes were edible, and its flowers, buds and leaves are often depicted on ancient monuments, in murals, on pottery and on furniture. Monarchs and priests of ancient Egypt were laid to rest with wreaths made from the petals of the blue lotus, laid in concentric semi-circles from the chin downwards. There is also evidence, in the form of a painting in a tomb dating back to 3000-2500 BCE, that nymphaeas were deliberately cultivated in square, evenly spaced beds fed by canals. The blooms were in great demand for religious festivals, offerings of the flowers being made to the dead or to the gods, as well as for gifts to visiting noblemen as a gesture of friendship and goodwill. And later on, both Amenhotep IV and Ramses III (1225 BCE) are known to have had them growing purely for their ornamental value in their palace gardens. The reason for their veneration lies in the belief that the beautiful blooms of the water lily, rising pure and clean from the slimy mud, were comparable with the aspirations of mankind: purity and immortality.",,"Back home, in earlier times (c. 1800) in South Africa, the rootstock of the blue water lily was collected and eaten, either raw or in curries, in particular by the Cape Malays and farming communities in the Cape. Today, only waterblommetjies, Aponogeton distachyos, are still eaten.

Water lilies are without doubt the most beautiful aquatic plants and are a must for every sunny water garden. But they need not only be used in ponds. Innovative gardeners with small gardens and sunny courtyards can enjoy them too, as they can be successfully grown in a variety of water-filled pottery containers, wooden barrels, old kitchen sinks and water features. They are simple to grow. All they need is full sun, some good soil and at least 30 cm of still water. Full sun is necessary for the plants to grow vigorously and produce flowers as well as for the flowers to open during the day. They do not like to be in a pond with a fountain or in swiftly moving water; neither do they like wind.

Nymphaea nouchali var. caerulea grows easily in any part of southern Africa, including the highveld and can be considered hardy to a winter minimum of -1 to 4 oC / 30 to 40 oF (Zone 10). In climates colder than this they will most likely be killed if left outdoors during winter. Although the blue water lily does go dormant during the winter, it should be left in the water throughout its dormancy. At the coast they keep their leaves during winter.

Two planting methods are commonly used for water lilies. Either the pond floor can be covered with about 15cm of a sand and compost mixture and the plants grown directly in this, or else they can be planted in a container which is sunk into the pond. The latter method is often preferred as the plants are more easily removed for inspection or division, or for the pond to be cleaned. Specially manufactured plastic water lily baskets are the most suitable and are available from most garden centres. As they have latticework sides, it is advisable to line them with hessian before planting to prevent soil spillage into the water.

Water lilies are heavy feeders. In a natural pond the accumulation of humus at the bottom is sufficient to maintain lush growth. In artificial ponds and particularly for container grown plants, it is important to add sufficient nutrients to the soil. If not the plant will soon use up all available nutrients and stop thriving. Just about every water lily enthusiast will have his or her preferred soil mixture. Good sieved garden loam is a recommended base although some swear by pure unwashed river sand. It can be mixed with artificial fertiliser, or two parts loam can be mixed with 1 part well rotted cow manure or equal parts loam, compost and well-rotted cow manure can be used. If using cow manure and compost it is important that it not be allowed to come into direct contact with the water. Coarse ground hoof and horn or bonemeal can also be mixed in. However, it is a delicate balance because if too much nitrogen rich material or fertiliser is used, it can cause an algae bloom in the pond which will leave your fish swimming in pea-soupy water. Also, it may encourage your water lilies to over exuberant growth. If you are too stingy with fertiliser and the potted water lilies fail to thrive, a slow release fertiliser pill can be pushed into the soil near the roots.

The crowns of the lily (the part of the plant where the leaves all originate from) should be planted firmly just protruding above the surface of the soil and the soil should be covered with a layer of river sand and pebbles in order to keep the water clean. The container should be drenched, and then placed a few centimetres below the surface of the water or to where its leaves float naturally (i.e. to the level it was in the Garden Centre). If your pond is deeper, the plant will adjust as the petioles respond quite quickly to relatively small changes in depth. Nymphaea nouchali var. caerulea requires about 30 cm, but no more than 90 cm. of water above its crown.

An easy way to get loose, uprooted full grown plants established in a natural or soil-filled pond is to tie a weight around the base of the stem and then toss it into the pond where you would like the new plant to grow. Make sure that the depth is adequate, and the leaves will find their own level and within a few weeks the roots will have grown into the mud/sand at the bottom of your pond. A new plant can also be bagged with soil in a hessian square, the four corners tied into a package which is lowered into a natural or soil-filled pond. The hessian will eventually rot by which time the plant will be established on the pond floor.

The easiest method of propagation is division. Plants may be left in place for two years, but pot-grown plants are best lifted, divided and planted in fresh soil each year for good results. The plants are best lifted and divided just before new growth commences in the spring (August). Pull or cut the fleshy roots (rhizomes) apart and replant immediately in fresh soil mixture. Each new plant should have at least one bud at the tip of the rhizome.

The blue water lily may be grown from seed, but this requires patience, for the plants take 3 to 4 years to flower. It is difficult to collect the seed, because the seed pods burst without much warning and the seeds disperse and sink quite soon. A common practice is to tie a muslin bag around the ripening pod. In this way after it bursts, the seeds cannot float away. The seed can be sown in spring and during summer (September-January). Finely sieved clean loam soil without any organic matter or fertiliser is best. Seed should be sown thinly, covered lightly with soil and then plunged into shallow water, no deeper than 2.5 cm, and placed in a sunny position. Germination should take 3-4 weeks The seedlings will look like fine grass at first, developing true leaves later. When the first two or three floating leaves appear the seedling should be pricked out and planted into individual containers and immersed back in the water. They may be submerged into deeper water and larger containers as they grow and lengthen.","In China water lilies are thought to have been grown for many years. There is a beautiful passage by Chou Tun-I of the eleventh century T'ang Dynasty: "" . . my favourite is the water lily. How stainless it rises form its slimy bed. How modestly it reposes on the clear pool, an emblem of purity and truth. Symmetrically perfect, its subtle perfume is wafted far and wide; while there it rests in spotless state, something to be regarded reverently from a distance, and not to be profaned by familiar approach."". It has also long been cultivated by the Japanese.",#Fragrant,,,,,,
Pelargonium grossularioides,Pelargonium grossularioides,,"This is a very low-growing ground cover which flowers almost all year round and has stems which may grow as long as 0.5 m. The furrowed, angular stems tend to have internodes, which are generally in shades of pale to deep reddish in colour. The outline of the long-stalked leaves is rounded to kidney-shaped, with the basal leaves being larger than those towards the ends of the stems. They are incised into 3-5 lobes and vary in size from 10-40 x 10-60 mm. Leaves often have a reddish outline and older leaves are sometimes richly coloured in shades of red. The more or less hairy stems and leaves are aromatic.

Flowers are small (less than 10 mm across) and vary from pale pink to a beetroot purple in colour. The occasional whitish flower is found. The compact, umbel-like flowerheads may have from 3 to 50 flowers on each one. This herb is a quick growing plant which usually only lasts about a year.","The name Pelargonium is derived from the seed head, which looks like the bill of a stork, from the Greek word pelargos, stork. The species name, grossularioides, is derived from Grossularia , which is the scientific name for the gooseberry, and oides , which means resemblance in Greek. Hence the English common name gooseberry-leaved pelargonium. The rooi portion in the Afrikaans common names refers to the colouring of the stems.

","Pelargonium grossularioides has a fairly wide distribution, occurring from the southwestern Cape, northeastward up into Mozambique , mainly along the coastal belt but also to an extent further inland. It is also found on the island of Tristan da Cunha. In Kenya, California and India it is recorded as an alien species.

Pelargonium grossularioides is one of about 270 species of Pelargonium , most of which occur in southern Africa, and of these most are found in the southwestern Cape. A few species are also found on a few of the Indian Ocean islands, in Australia, Syria and tropical Africa. P. cucullatum, which is one of the parents of thousands of hybrids currently grown, was first collected on Table Mountain by a Dutch botanist, Paul Hermann, who took it back to Europe. Pelargonium varieties are cultivated all over the world and are very popular as both bedding plants and in flower boxes. Many Pelargonium species and varieties are still mistakenly referred to as geraniums, but geraniums have flowers which are regular in shape, and may be divided into equal halves in any plane, whereas the pelargoniums can be divided into equal halves in only one plane.",,"It grows best in damp soils, either in partial shade or full sun, and is equally at home in the winter rainfall region of the southwestern Cape and the all year or summer rainfall areas in the tropics. In some areas it may be considered a weedy species. Bees that are looking for nectar probably pollinate it.

This species may be grown from cuttings or from seed. March and/or April are good times for sowing of seed or growing on from cuttings. For both, use a well-drained mix, which will not become waterlogged, but which remains moist at all times. A sandy loam or a mix made of equal parts of sand and fine peat moss would be suitable. Pasteurised soil mixes are advantageous as they minimise attack from diseases. It is best to sow the seeds individually or place the cuttings individually into small pots or 6 or 12 plug packs so that roots have minimum disturbance when potted on into larger containers or planted out in situ. Seeds may be removed from their seed cases if desired, using a needle inserted into the groove below the style, or sown, as is, about 5 mm below the surface of the mix. It is most important that the mix is kept moist at all times to prevent the germinating seed and seedlings from drying out. Pot on into larger containers or plant out in situ once the plants have developed several good-sized leaves and are 50-70 mm tall. When repotting or planting out try to disturb roots as little as possible by adding soil mix to the base and sides of the new pot. A very dilute, water-soluble fertilizer may be used at about every third or fourth watering if necessary.",,,"In the past, the Cape Malay people used to use decoctions of this plant for pregnant women. At times it was used to abort a foetus, or to hurry the process of confinement and was also helpful in expelling the placenta.

Horticulturally it may be used as a groundcover in damp areas or as a pot plant.

This would be a useful species where a very low-growing groundcover is needed for a damp area, such as round stepping stones and in shady areas. It could also be used to spill over the edge of a large flowerpot planted with taller species, or at the sides of a window box.",,,,,
Jasminum angulare,Jasminum angulare,,"Jasminum angulare is a scrambling and climbing shrub that can reach up to 7 m high in trees.

Branchlets are 4–6 angled, at least in part. The branchlets and leaves may be hairless or conspicuously hairy; sometimes hairy and hairless plants occur side by side.

Leaves are made up of three leaflets (3-foliate), very occasionally 5-foliate. The leaflets are variable in shape, usually broadly ovate with an acute apex. Acarodomatia (pits in the leaves - see Ecology) are often present on the under surface of the leaves, in the axils of lower veins.

The flowers are pure white, strongly fragrant and produced in flat-topped, few-flowered inflorescences at the tips of the stems, from early to mid-summer (October to January). They have a long, narrow corolla tube, usually greenish on the outside, opening to a flat, white star, made up of five petal lobes, although the occasional flower has six lobes. There are two stamens that are inside the corolla tube, with the tips of the anthers to be seen in the mouth of the tube. The style is 2-lobed and the tip is exserted. The calyx, at the base of the corolla tube, is bell-shaped, green, and 7-toothed. The fruit is a spherical berry, about 7 mm in diameter.

Jasminum angulare occurs in coastal and inland bush from Ladismith in the Karoo to the Eastern Cape, Free State, KwaZulu-Natal and Mpumalanga. It is found growing among boulders on hillsides and near rivers.","The genus name Jasminum is the Latinized version of the Arabic name for jasmine, ysmyn or yasamin meaning ‘gift from God’. The species name angulare is from Latin and means ‘angular’, referring to the angled branchlets.","Jasminum belongs in the olive family. It is a large genus of about 450 species spread through tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa and Australia. There are 11 species in southern Africa, where they are widespread.

The best known and most frequently cultivated jasmine is Jasminum officinale, which is indigenous to central Asia and has been cultivated for its intensely fragrant flowers since ancient times. Another indigenous jasmine that is frequently grown as an ornamental is the Starry Wild Jasmine (Jasminum multipartitum).

Acarodomatia, or ‘mite houses’ are little pits in the leaves, usually in the axils of the veins, and are occupied by mites. The mites usually benefit the plant in some way, either by preying on other mites and insects, or consuming fungi.

The flowers are probably pollinated by moths. Birds eat the berry-like fruits and disperse the seeds in their droppings.

",,"This species is grown as an ornamental in gardens. The flowers are strongly sweet-scented and can be added to pot-pourris mixtures.

Grow Jasminum angulare in sun or semi-shade. It performs best in fertile, loamy, well composted soil. They can be slow to get going, but are strong growers when established. It is drought tolerant, but performs better with at least moderate watering during spring and summer. It can withstand a few degrees below freezing, but is best in frost-free regions.

Propagate Jasminum angulare by cuttings, layering or seeds. Take semi-hardwood cuttings in spring or summer, when the plants are in active growth. Treat with a rooting hormone and place in the mist unit on heated benches. Plants also send out long runners, which often root far away from the mother plant. These can be detached and potted, or the runners along the ground can be encouraged to root by layering. Sow seed in spring or summer. Clean the flesh off the berries and sow the seeds in sterile, well-drained seedling mix, keep warm and moist. Pot up when the seedlings are large enough to handle. Pot seedlings and rooted cuttings into loamy, well-composted potting soil and grow on in light shade for the first year.

Train up a trellis or arch, or along a fence, or use as a groundcover, or train into a rounded bush. This plant is particularly lovely near the house or in an area of the garden that is well visited, or around the outdoor sitting area, where the sweet scent of the flowers can be enjoyed, and they are also fragrant in the evenings. It does well in containers.

",,,Jasminum angulare leaves and flowers are used in traditional medicine as a protective charm against lightning.,"Jasminum angulare is not threatened, and is assessed as Least Concern (LC) according to the Red List of South African plants.

Fresh leaves are reported to be toxic to sheep and cattle, and may cause death to the animal within 8 hours of ingestion.",,,,
Protea laurifolia,Protea laurifolia,,"Protea laurifolia is a large, upright, well-branched shrub, 3-5 m tall, or small tree up to 8 m high, with a short, stout main trunk up to 300 mm in diameter and branching from about 200 mm above ground level. Leaves are elliptic, broader in the middle and tapering to the base and apex, 80-140 x 10-55 mm. The petiole is very short, 3-20 mm, and the apex is tipped with a short spine (mucronate). The midrib is prominent and the margins are very prominent and heavily thickened. The leaves are covered with minute soft hairs when young but hairless when mature, and the leaf surface is coated with a whitish to blue-green bloom that can be rubbed off (glaucous), giving the whole bush a greyish green colour.","The genus Protea was named by Linnaeus after the Greek god Proteus who could change his form at will, because the proteas are so different in form. The species name laurifolia means laurel-leafed, referring to the resemblance of the foliage to that of the laurel, Laurus.

Protea laurifolia was described in scientific literature in 1803 by Carl Peter Thunberg from specimens that he collected himself during his visit to the Cape between 1772 and 1775. In 1802, plants raised from seeds collected by James Niven, flowered in George Hibbert's conservatory in Clapham, London. In 1803, Henry Andrews published a coloured engraving of a flower head taken from one of Hibbert's plants.","The Protea flower is not a flower, but a flower head or inflorescence, made up of many individual flowers grouped together on a rounded base or receptacle. What looks like the 'petals' of the protea 'flower' are modified leaves known as floral or involucral bracts. Look inside the cup of involucral bracts and you'll see many long narrow flowers massed together in the centre.

The flower head is oblong, 100-130 x 40-60 mm. The involucral bracts are a silky silvery pink, or faded pink, or cream, with a thick beard on the inner bracts. The beard can be purple-black, white or mixed white and black. The individual flowers are 75-90 mm long and are also densely covered with purple-black or white hairs. The main flowering time is during autumn-winter (May to July), but flower heads can be found from autumn until early summer (April to November).

The fruit is a small, dry, hairy nut. Seeds are held inside the flower until the branch or bush dies. For harvesting purposes, the seeds should be left on the bush to ripen for a period of about seven months. Only a few viable seeds are produced per head.

Protea laurifolia is very similar to P. neriifolia and is often confused with it. They can be told apart by their foliage: P. laurifolia leaves are elliptic (broader in the middle) and have heavily thickened, horny margins and a grey bloom that can be rubbed off, whereas those of P. neriifolia are dark to bright green and narrowly oblong with margins that are parallel for most of their length, and are not heavily thickened and don't have a greyish bloom. Also, P. laurifolia has a petiole, even though it is very short, whereas P. neriifolia has no petiole at all. There are variants of P. laurifolia that have less of the greyish bloom on their leaves and some P. neriifolia plants with blue-grey leaves, which are more difficult to distinguish.

The Proteaceae is a family of ± 75 genera and ± 1350 species that occur in Africa, Madagascar, southeast Asia, Malaysia, Pacific Islands, Australasia and South America. There are 16 genera and ± 360 species in southern Africa. The genus Protea contains ± 112 species, all of which occur only in Africa and 89 (79 %) of them in southern Africa, mainly in the Western Cape.

Protea laurifolia is pollinated by the Sugarbird, Promerops cafer. Nectar is found at the base of each flower. To get to it, the Sugarbird has to push its head between the massed flowers to reach the nectar at the base; while doing this, pollen is rubbed off onto the bird's head. It then flies off to another bush and transfers its load of pollen to other flowers while it picks up some more. Sugarbirds pollinate many species of Protea.

Inter-species hybrids do occur, particularly where some species that don't occur together naturally are being cultivated near each other. This has become a problem where the hybrids are occurring in natural areas, which indicates that nearby cultivated plants are contaminating the gene pools of wild species. Should the hybrids set viable seed and continue to breed with the wild species, it could permanently alter or even wipe out the wild species. Natural hybrids of P. laurifolia with P. nitida and with P. magnifica have been found, and P. laurifolia is known to hybridize naturally with P. burchellii.

The flower heads are also visited by many insects, including the protea beetle, which comes in search of pollen and nectar. The protea beetles are large and brush the pollen onto themselves as they move through the flower head and do effect pollination, but a study by the Agricultural Research Council has shown that insect-pollinated seeds have lighter embryos, lower seed set and slower germination than bird-pollinated seeds. Sunbirds also feed on the nectar, but they do not effect pollination as they 'cheat' by sticking their beaks into the side of the flower heads straight to the base of the flowers, bypassing the pollen.

Protea laurifolia plants are killed by fire but they release thousands of seeds that are stored in the old flower heads, the seeds are dispersed by the wind, and germinate en masse after the autumn rains.

Protea seeds are covered in long hairs. These hairs aid in dispersal and germination: by expanding as the flower head opens, forcing them out of the head; once they are out, the hairs allow the seeds to be more easily moved by the wind; and once they land on the soil the hairs help to anchor the seed to the ground; and finally, the hairs help orientate the seed the right way round and channel water towards it.

",,"Protea laurifolia occurs on the inland mountains of the Western Cape from the Bokkeveld escarpment near Nieuwoudtville southwards along the Gifberg, Cedarberg, Olifants River, Koue Bokkeveld, Tulbagh, Bain's Kloof, Du Toit's Kloof, Paarl and Franschoek Mountains to Villiersdorp, and then eastwards from the Riversonderend Mountains to McGregor. Populations also occur on Heerenlogementberg, Piketberg and Paardeberg, and further inland it skirts the western edge of the Karoo, occurring along the Cedarberg, Swartruggens Escarpment, at Karoo Poort, on the Bonteberg, Witteberg and on the Worcester Hex River Mountains, the Langeberg and Anysberg. P. laurifolia covers vast stretches of mountainside between 400 and 1200 m.

It grows mainly on sandstone or quartzite-derived soils, or Cape granite, but will also grow on Bokkeveld shale, which most proteas cannot tolerate. Where it receives more moisture, it forms dense stands, but it typically favours the drier, very well-drained sites where the plants are more widely dispersed, forming low open woodland. Protea laurifolia is very drought tolerant and can be seen surviving in very inhospitable places, and is a common sight on the bleak, semi-arid landscapes of the Cedarberg and Koue Bokkeveld.

Although Protea laurifolia is an excellent, long-lasting cutflower, it is not grown for the export market. It is a valuable source of firewood particularly in the more arid regions of its distribution range where it is often the only woody species in the veld.

Protea laurifolia is slow growing, taking up to seven years to flower for the first time from seed, but very long-lived for a protea, outliving most other proteas in the garden and still looking good after 30 years or more. Some of the larger wild specimens are estimated to be 70 or 80 years old. It is easy to grow in that it is tolerant of a wider range of soil types than most proteas. The soil must be well-drained, but it will thrive in acidic, neutral or slightly alkaline soil.

Like other proteas, it is a light feeder with a sensitive root system that is adapted to very nutrient-poor soils. It will not tolerate strong fertilizers and manures, but should be fed with well-rotted compost and if using chemical fertilizers, choose a slow-release one or apply very low doses. Proteas don't like phosphates (P), so choose a fertilizer that has little or no P in its formula.

Plant P. laurifolia in a sunny position with free air circulation - the more shaded and sheltered its position the more likely it will be affected by fungal infections. P. laurifolia is very drought tolerant and does not need much supplementary watering once established. Allow it at least two summers with regular watering to become established. Keep root disturbance to a minimum; protea roots are very susceptible to infection so try not to break them by digging around their base inside their drip-line, rather put down a thick layer of mulch once or twice a year and leave them undisturbed.

Protea laurifolia is hardy to cold and frost and should survive outdoors in zone 9 (-7 to -1°C/20-30°F).

Grow Protea laurifolia in the water-wise garden, the fynbos garden, or the arid garden, or in that difficult, hot, dry and windy spot where nothing else seems to thrive. It is a large, long-lived, dense and bushy shrub and is suited to background planting or screening. It provides a steady supply of beautiful flowers for the vase throughout the winter months.

Protea laurifolia is easily raised from seed, sown in autumn, in well-drained soil, lightly covered with clean sand or fine-milled bark and kept moist but not wet. Germination occurs after about 30 days. Treating the seed with a fungicide increases the number of surviving seedlings. Transplant into individual containers as soon as the first pair of true leaves have developed. Seedlings are slow-growing, and the first flowers can be expected in its seventh year.

It can also be propagated by semi-hardwood cuttings taken from the current season's growth, in autumn or spring. Remove the leaves from the basal third of the cutting, treat with a rooting hormone, and place in a well-drained rooting medium under intermittent mist with a bottom heat of 25°C.",,,,"Protea laurifolia is not threatened, it is one of the most common of the proteas, with a wide distribution.

",,,,
Felicia amelloides,Felicia amelloides,,"This felicia is usually a perennial, evergreen shrublet, about 0.3-0.6 x 0.5 m but it can be up to 1 m high. It is densely branched and frequently has dark reddish stems. The plant often feels like fine sandpaper because of tiny, stiff hairs on the stems and leaves. The leaves are opposite and more or less elliptical, dark green above and light green below. (A cultivar, cv. variegata, with variegated green and white leaves is also available.)

The flowerheads are typical of the Asteraceae and are about 30 mm in diameter and are borne on naked stalks up to 180 mm long. Unlike many daisies, these do not close at night. Inside the green involucre (bracts surrounding base of flowerhead), each head has about 12 female ray florets that are sky-blue, or rarely mauve (white-flowered and pale blue forms are now offered by nurseries). In the centre there are numerous yellow, bisexual disc florets. All florets have a pappus of a single ring of many stiff, white bristles, The fruits, called achenes, are darkish brown and minutely hairy. Each fruit is shed together with its pappus that acts like a parachute.

The natural time of flowering is a little uncertain as Goldblatt & Manning (2000) give it as mainly October to February, while specimens in the National Herbarium are dated from March to December, with most in September. In Pretoria gardens they flower almost throughout the year, with most flowers in spring and early summer. They live a long time, usually at least five years, under normal conditions.",,"This species comes from the coastal strip of both the Western and Eastern Cape Provinces, mainly from Humansdorp to Port Alfred. It has been recorded from as far west as the De Hoop-Potberg Nature Reserve and it reaches the Kei River mouth to the east. The furthest inland it extends seems to be to the Vanstadensberg and Winterhoek Mountains near Port Elizabeth and Uitenhage, and the Ecca Pass, near Grahamstown. For a long time it was thought that this felicia occurs in the Cape Peninsula. This was because of confusion with other species such as F. aethiopica, which has closely similar flowers but alternate leaves. The habitat of F. amelloides ranges in altitude from 0-1 000 m.

This felicia is mainly found on old coastal sand dunes that are beginning to stabilize, or where dunes meet permanent bush or where there is any shelter. It is also found on sandy flats, exposed stony hillsides, gravelly slopes, outcrops of Table Mountain Sandstone and on rock slabs. The associated vegetation has been described as fynbos (sometimes called macchia), transition fynbos/bush, coastal scrub, thick scrub, ericoid vegetation and Stoebe plumosa communities.

The blue felicia bush receives some rain all year round in much of its natural area and endures a wide range of temperatures, including some frost. It does not seem to need the regular coastal mists as it grows well in inland gardens. With this natural distribution and habitat, it could be grown in many parts of South Africa, except, perhaps, where there is very high rainfall and heavy frost. Good drainage and some shelter would probably overcome these problems.

There are many possible indigenous companion plants, with roughly similar cultivation needs. The choice will depend on the colour scheme, position of planting, plant availability and type of plants wanted - perennials or a mixture including annuals. Check flowering times to get flowers throughout the year. It would be wise, too, to use plants suited to the local rainfall pattern, although this is not essential. In a sunny place, the selection could include Geranium incanum (carpet geranium), Hemizygia transvaalensis (pink salvia), Nylandtia spinosa (tortoise berry), Pelargonium crispum (crispy-leaved pelargonium) or P. reniforme (kidney-leaved pelargonium) and Scabiosa africana (pincushion). In semishade one could use Crassula multicava (fairy crassula), Hypoestes aristata (ribbon bush) and Veltheimia bracteata (bush lily). This felicia could make an effective base for Strelitzia reginae (crane flower) in semishade or sun.

A lovely contrast can be achieved by mixing plants with different leaf types. The blue felicia bush goes well with bulbs like Agapanthus, Bulbine frutescens (stalked bulbine), Eucomis autumnalis (pineapple flower), Hypoxis hemerocallidea (star flower or African potato) and Watsonia. Another type of contrast, much used in the Pretoria NBG, is the inclusion of grey or whitish-leaved plants among the green ones. They have a cooling effect and look good in all seasons. (They are mostly from dryer areas, so one would have to watch the amount of water or have very good drainage.) Examples are Gazania rigens (trailing gazania), Helichrysum argyrophyllum (everlasting), H. splendidum ( Cape gold) and Ursinia sericea (lace-leaf ursinia). The darker leaved Euryops pectinatus (grey euryops) would also give an interesting contrast. It flowers mostly in winter.

A grouping of various daisies is also attractive and friendly looking. Plants such as Cotula spp. (= Cenia ), Dimorphotheca ecklonis (blue-and-white daisy bush = Osteospermum ecklonis ), D. jucunda ( bergbitou = O. jucundum ), Gerbera jamesonii ( Barberton daisy), Pentzia grandiflora (matricaria) and Phaenocoma prolifera ( Cape everlasting) could be planted together. Although they are not true daisies, species of Lampranthus (vygies) could also be used as the flowers look like daisies and the leaves make a good contrast. Interplanting with annuals would allow one to make regular changes to a bed. Suggested annuals are Arctotis fastuosa ( bittergousblom ), A. acaulis (bushy arctotis), Dimorphotheca pluvialis (white Namaqualand daisy), D. sinuata ( Namaqualand daisies), Felicia elongata (tricolour felicia) and Ceratotheca triloba (wild foxglove), although the last might get rather tall. Lastly, one could make a 'blue' bed by using flowers like dwarf agapanthus, Anchusa capensis (forget-me-not) and Merwilla plumbea (blue squill).",,"The genus Felicia Cass. was named by A.H.G. de Cassini in 1818 after Felix, a German official at Regensburg who died in 1846. F. amelloides was first named Cineraria amelloides by Linnaeus in 1763. Andreas Voss (1857-1924), a German author on horticulture, botanical nomenclature and meteorology, made the combination Felicia amelloides in 1894. The specific name amelloides means it looks like Amellus, a closely similar genus also found in the Western and Eastern Cape. Within the family Asteraceae, or daisy family, these two genera are placed in the tribe Astereae which includes Aster, Conyza (fleabanes), Erigeron (exotic garden escape), Chrysocoma (bitterbos) and Pteronia (including biltongbos ). There has been much controversy as to whether Felicia should be separated from Aster, but they are currently regarded as distinct genera. This is mainly because of differences in the fruit. Felicia is centred in southern Africa but it ranges as far north as Arabia. There are about 84 species of which about 79 occur in southern Africa. Most are found in the Cape provinces of South Africa.

The blue felicia bush was introduced to Europe in the middle of the eighteenth century and hence was one of the first species used in horticulture. Several others are now grown in gardens, for example F. australis (blue Karoo daisy), F. bergeriana (kingfisher daisy), F. echinata (prickly felicia) and F. heterophylla (true-blue daisy). The one most recently described, F. josephinae, an annual from the west coast near Lambert's Bay, has strikingly different colouring. It has white to cream-coloured ray florets and deep purple disc florets and appears to have much horticultural potential.

The place should preferably be sunny but it will flower if planted as a groundcover in light shade under trees or in small beds making a blue collar around tree trunks. It needs a light, sandy or gravelly soil with good drainage and much compost if possible. Give a dressing of fertilizer for flowering plants (with ratio of N:P:K = 3:1:5) or a general fertilizer (ratio of 2:3:2) and mix some super phosphate into the soil. Water it regularly, but moderately, especially during the dry season.

Propagate by seed or cuttings in spring (August and September). The latter method is quicker and the resultant plants should flower in about a year.

For cuttings (A. Eissell pers. comm.), select nonflowering stems and cut them just below a node. Strip off most leaves and side shoots, leaving a couple of upper ones. Place the stems in damp sand or a 1:1 mixture of fine pine bark or small polystyrene balls and sand. Cover them with a plastic bag or clear, cold drink bottle to help keep them moist. Removal of a small, vertical strip of skin will improve water absorption. Shorten the time for rooting by using rooting powder but take care not to use too much as it can burn the stems. Dip dry stems in the powder and tap off any excess before putting them in sand.

Established plants often self-seed easily so seedlings may be found nearby or at quite a distance. These can be transplanted to a new position.

Once established, this felicia is quick growing and can look good for many years. When young, it can be made to bush well if the main shoots are pinched out. Light pruning during the summer will encourage more crops of flowers. To improve appearance, cut off the many old flowers. After about three years, it may need to be cut back if it gets straggly. If it becomes frost-damaged, it will usually resprout and flower a little later than usual. The same holds for plants that survive trampling and excavations by lizard-hunting dogs! It does not seem to suffer from pests very much, making it even more carefree for the gardener.

",,,"Felicia amelloides can be seen on one of our South African stamps. It is used mainly as an ornamental plant; because of its ability to live in sandy areas, it can help to stabilize sand dunes, albeit not as a pioneer.

There are many uses for this felicia in the garden. It makes a good rockery plant or can be placed in a herbaceous border with other perennials or a mixture of annuals and perennials. It could form the front of a shrub border or be used in a large window box or planter. It can be planted singly and left free to form a low bush. Alternatively, a line of plants can make a low, informal hedge or it can be clipped to make an unusual formal one.

","There appears to be no major threat to the survival of F. amelloides in the wild at present. However, the coastal areas it occupies are increasingly being threatened by holiday homes and other developments. Hence the status may change. Fortunately it is common in horticulture in South Africa and is also grown in Europe.

Felicias are visited by bees and small flying insects, such as wasps and butterflies. They also have tiny thrips running around the florets, usually carrying pollen grains on their bodies. Sometimes a bright yellow 'flower' spider lurks in the daisy's centre, matching the disc florets perfectly. Whatever animal achieves pollination, it is generally very successful as full heads of seed are the norm. The involucre opens outwards in an old flower so the achenes are completely exposed. They readily become detached and float away on even a slight breeze by means of the pappus. Two felicias, F. filifolia ( draaibos ) and F. muricata ( bloublommetjie-karoo ) are among the hosts of a parasite, Thesium namaquense (poison bush). This causes stock poisoning, mainly in sheep, in the Northern and Eastern Cape.

Liparia splendens subsp. splendens,Liparia splendens subsp. splendens,,"Liparia splendens ssp. splendens is a much-branched, upright, resprouting shrub, usually about 1 m tall.

Leaves are simple, alternate, sessile, hairless, elliptical and usually end in a sharp long point. The veins are prominent, and three or more primary veins arise from the base. Dead leaves dry black.

From autumn until summer (May-Jan) it bears large, rounded, nodding heads, up to 70 x 85 mm, at the tips of the branches. Each head consists of 15-17 bright orange to yellow flowers densely packed among conspicuous dark reddish-brown petal-like bracts. Should you wish to damage the beautiful head and remove a single flower to examine it more closely, you will find that the flowers possess all the elements of a typical papilionoid (""butterfly-like"") legume flower. That is, five petals: a large standard petal, two lateral wing petals and the two lower petals joined along their lower margin to form the keel that encloses the stamens and pistil. In Liparia splendens the wing petals are unusual in that they are folded around the keel with interlocking lobes. There are 10 stamens, 1 is free and the other 9 are fused to form a short open tube. The style is longer than the stamens so that the stigma sticks out slightly beyond the anthers.

Seeds are brown, bean-shaped, ±6 mm long and ±3 mm wide, and the pods are ± 30 mm long and hairy. The pods split explosively to release the seeds.","The genus Liparia is named from the Greek liparos meaning oily or shiny or brilliant, referring either to the hairless (shiny) leaves or the brilliant flowers. The species name splendens is Latin and also means to shine, be bright or radiant, or distinguished - or in a word: splendid! The common name skaamblom means 'shy flower', alluding to the way it shyly bows its flowerheads, and the name geelkoppie meaning 'little yellow head' refers to its showy head ( koppie ) of yellow-orange flowers.

Liparia splendens first appeared in literature in 1704, in John Ray's Histora Plantarum under the name Genista africana rusci foliis etc. (Bos). Ray got his plant material from Sherard, which implies that the plant described was already growing in Sherard's garden, most likely raised from seed imported at an earlier date. It next appears in the Prodromus Flora Capensis (1768) published by N.L. Burmann under the name Leucadendron splendens, incorrectly placed in Proteaceae (Bos). This publication was based on the collection of Cape plants of his father, J. Burmann. The first publication of Liparia as a new genus was by Linnaeus in the second Mantissa of 1771 (Bos). He gave an extensive generic description and described six species with Liparia sphaerica as the type species.

A colour illustration of Liparia sphaerica was published in Curtis's Botanical Magazine in 1809 (reproduced on the Aluka website). More species were proposed over the years until 1825 when De Candolle studied all the material and excluded all but one species from Liparia and placed the rest into the genera Priestleya, Rafnia or Borbonia. It was during this study that De Candolle established that Burmann's Leucadendron splendens and Linnaeus' Liparia sphaerica were one and the same. Burmann's name is the earlier one, and therefore takes precedence, which is why this species is now called Liparia splendens and Liparia sphaerica is a synonym. When J.J. Bos revised the genus in 1967, he accepted De Candolle's concept of the genus, describing only two species: L. splendens, divided into the two subspecies, and L. parva.

But, the story does not end there. In 1991 Van Wyk, Verdoorn and Greinwald published their results on comparative analyses of the alkaloids in Liparia splendens and L. parva. Although the two species look similar, they contain different alkaloid patterns, which shows that they are considerably different. The two species also show structural differences in their inflorescence and flowers and it is thought that adaptation to different pollination mechanisms by the two species is what has led to the wide gap between them.","Liparia splendens is divided into two subspecies: subsp. splendens and subsp. comantha. To tell them apart, examine the edges of the flower-bearing bracts and lower calyx lobes; in subsp. splendens more than half of the circumference is hairless, whereas in subsp. comantha more than half of the circumference is hairy. The flowerheads of subsp. comantha are also marginally smaller (up to 60 x 70 mm) than those of subsp. splendens (up to 70 x 85 mm).

Liparia splendens ssp. splendens is found in mountain and lowland fynbos growing on rocky hills and mountain slopes, often on the cooler, damper side of mountains, at 20-1000 m, in soil derived from Table Mountain sandstone. It occurs on the Cape Peninsula and Cape Flats, south of Paarl and west of the Hottentots Holland. Plants can be seen growing wild on the slopes of Table Mountain above Kirstenbosch. Liparia splendens subsp. comantha occurs east of the Hottentots Holland Mountains, from Somerset-West, to Caledon, Bredasdorp, Swellendam and Riversdale to Albertinia.","Liparia parva with its hidden flowers at ground-level, similar in colour and odour to mammal-pollinated proteas, is most likely mammal pollinated, while Liparia splendens has adapted to bird pollination. This study led to the 1994 re-evaluation of the generic delimitation of Priestleya and Liparia by Schutte and Van Wyk and the 1997 revision by Schutte. Until then, it was the shape and size of the keel petals and number of flowers per inflorescence that was used to separate the species. But, the unique combination alkaloids they share, as well as other distinctive characteristics, shows that they are actually one genus, and the differences in the flowers and inflorescences are caused by adaptations to different pollination strategies. Priestleya was therefore returned to Liparia in which 20 species are now recognized.

Liparia splendens like many legumes, possesses root nodules that fix nitrogen in the soil.","All Liparia species are found only in the fynbos biome with the highest concentration of species in the southwestern Cape. Only one species distribution extends beyond the Western Cape into the Eastern Cape.

Liparia splendens is visited by both sunbirds and carpenter bees in search of nectar, but the pollinator is the sunbird. When the sunbird pushes its head between the petals to get to the nectar, it causes the stamens and style to pop out from the enclosing keel petals, which puts the pollen-bearing anthers and the stigma in contact with the bird's throat feathers. The bird then carries this pollen to the next flowerhead and repeats the process to bring about cross-pollination.

Liparia seeds have a fleshy collar-like aril that attracts ants. The ants carry the seeds away to their nests to consume the aril, dispersing the seeds in the process. This is known as myrmecochory.

Fynbos is fire adapted and plants have developed different strategies to survive fires, the main two being reseeding and resprouting. Liparia splendens is a resprouter. When a fire sweeps through a population the above ground parts are killed but it has a large underground rootstock, known as a lignotuber, which survives and sends out vigorous new growth soon after the fire. Resprouters are usually multi-stemmed at ground level. Reseeders are usually single-stemmed at ground level and the whole plant is killed by the fire, but they produce large amounts of seed that germinate en masse after a fire.

It is not easy to grow this fynbos shrub, but success can be achieved by mimicking its habitat. It likes well-drained, quartzitic, acidic soil, and does best amongst rocks. It needs ample water during autumn-winter-spring and some water during the summer, and it must drain away - soggy soil is sure to cause the rootstock to rot. It also prefers free movement of air and may be more prone to fungal infection in a still, humid position. It does well in full sun or half-day shade.

Grow it in a rockery, or on a rocky slope or embankment in well-drained, sandy soil. Mulch with well-rotted compost applied in spring and autumn and feed with an organic fertiliser. When the plant is established, pinch the tips to encourage branching. When well established, take out the older stems to encourage thickening of the rootstock and new stems to sprout from the rootstock. Old plants (8+ years) can get lanky and scrappy.

Fire has a rejuvenating effect on older plants. To rejuvenate an older garden plant, mimic a fire by cutting the old woody stems right back to the rootstock, but leave a few of the younger stems. This heavy pruning is best done in late summer, just before the rainy season begins in autumn, when the plant should resprout vigorously from the rootstock.

Liparia splendens is sensitive to frost and in cold climates is best grown in a cool, dry glasshouse suited to temperate Mediterranean flora. When growing Liparia splendens in a glasshouse, refrain from watering directly on the leaves or in the evening, as this may cause fungal infections. We have not tried long-term cultivation in containers. Liparia splendens may do well in a container, provided the soil is sandy and well-drained, it is placed in a well-ventilated area that is not too hot, and it is not overwatered.

Liparia splendens can be propagated from seed or cuttings.

From seed, first select the viable seeds by throwing them in a cup of water, the viable seeds will sink and the duds float. Best results are obtained if the seed is scarified to weaken the seed coat. This can be achieved by sandpapering each seed, or using a sharp blade to make a shallow cut into the seed coat or slicing a small piece of the seed coat off, but take care not to damage the embryo inside. Researchers at Kirstenbosch developed an ingenious method of sandpapering batches of seed: line a ± 10 cm diameter length of tube with coarse sandpaper, seal one end, put the seeds inside, plug the other end and shake them about inside, or use a paddle or stirring rod inside the tube to rub the seeds against the wall.

Next soak the seed overnight in hot water (not boiling - use water that will not scald your hand). Seed should then be sown, in late summer to autumn (March-April-May), in sterile, well-drained medium and kept warm and moist until germination. It is crucial that they be watered with a fungicide that combats both pre- and post-emergence damping off.

Germination from treated seed should take about 6 weeks. Without these treatments, you will find that many seeds swell but don't germinate, and those that germinate will either not make it to the surface (pre-emergence damping off) or will fail to thrive and die soon after producing apparently healthy cotyledons (post-emergence damping off). Another tip to increase the number of surviving seedlings is to minimise the root disturbance by sowing the seed in plugs or small containers, or to transplant the seedlings very early, while still in the cotyledon stage.

Cuttings can be taken late summer to autumn or spring to early summer. Best results are obtained from semi-hardwood growth straight from the rootstock - look for thin, new shoots at the base of the plant, and get a heel off the rootstock. Alternatively, take semi-hardwood tip cuttings. Treat with rooting hormone suitable for semi-hardwood material, plant in sterile, well-drained medium e.g. milled bark and polystyrene, and place in a mist unit with bottom heat ( ± 24 o C). As with seedlings, to minimise root disturbance plant the cuttings into plugs or small containers.

Acknowledgements Anthony Hitchcock for sharing his experience of growing and propagating Liparia splendens.","Although, as its common name suggests, it resembles a dahlia, Liparia splendens is not related to dahlias at all. Dahlias belong in the daisy family (Asteraceae) while Liparia is a member of the legume family (Fabaceae), a large diverse family of 650 genera and some 18 000 species.

During his study, Bos discovered a slug-like insect exactly resembling a leaf on a freshly picked Liparia splendens subsp. comantha specimen from Sir Lowry's Pass area. It was identified as a caterpillar of unusual habit. A second specimen was found and fed on fresh leaves of both subspecies until it proceeded to pupate and hatch into a moth that was identified as Homosusica eugrapha.",,"Liparia splendens is not used medicinally nor is it commonly cultivated.

","Liparia splendens ssp. splendens is classified as Vulnerable on the Interim Red Data List. The greatest threat is to the populations in lowland fynbos, as lowland fynbos is seriously threatened by urban development and agriculture. Liparia splendens is listed as Schedule 4 Protected Flora according to Western Cape Nature Conservation Laws Amendment Act, 2000.

Streptocarpus meyeri,Streptocarpus meyeri,,"This perennial has a rosulate cluster of 3 to 10, flat-growing leaves, all arising just slightly above the ground. The elliptically broad, 200 × 75 mm, rough, green leaves have shallow toothed margins and can become almost shaggy in appearance as they get older.

Delicate flower stems up to 200 mm long, arise from the base of each leaf’s midrib and can number as few as 2 or as many as twelve during the growing season. Clusters of trumpet-like, five-lobed, white flowers, sometimes pale violet on the outside at the base of the flower, occur in late summer and autumn, from January to April.

The flower usually has a single or split, yellow stripe on the floor of the corolla tube, with the violet colour within the flower throat and at the noticeably narrow mouth of the flower, varying from being absent, to pale violet, to a deep vibrant violet colour, with speckles or spreading streaks extending out along the petals. Fruits are spirally twisted, slender, pod-like capsules, filled with masses of minute seeds.","The name Streptocarpus is derived from the Greek words, streptos, meaning ‘twisted’ and, carpus, meaning ‘fruit’, which describes the spirally twisted seedpods characteristic of these plants. The species is named for Ernst Heinrich Friedrich Meyer or Carl Anton Meyer, both of whom were 19th century German botanists.

Brian Laurence Burtt, who named and described this species, was an English botanist and taxonomist who is known for his substantial contributions to the family Gesneriaceae. He first worked at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, and then at the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh in a career that spanned 74 years. Burtt made numerous field trips to South Africa and elsewhere in the world from which he described a total of 637 new plant species, of which the greater number were Gesneriaceae.","Occurs naturally in more exposed habitats on mountainous aspects yet still protected and shaded within rock cracks and fissures, or on south-facing rock walls and steep soil slopes in the Baviaanskloof Mountains in the Eastern Cape and in Mpumalanga Province.

Streptocarpus belongs to the same family, Gesneriaceae, as do the well-known African violets and gloxinias that are grown as popular pot plants all over the world. This is a large family of mostly tropical and subtropical herbs, with ± 130 genera, and ± 2 900 species worldwide. There are 8 genera in Africa, with the single genus, Streptocarpus, in South Africa and it has ± 51 species. The family is named after Konrad Gesner. He was a Swiss scholar, and in 1963, 30 years after his death, his name was given to this family.

Gesneriaceae are often epiphytic (growing on trees) or lithophytic (growing on rocks).

Streptocarpus flowers often have nectar guidelines that guide would-be pollinators (birds, long-tongued flies and moths, butterflies and bees) to the nectar. The plants can easily be cross pollinated with other species, but in many instances, are self-pollinated. The very small seeds are dispersed by wind.",,"Although this species is a challenge to find and cultivate, there are many easy-to-grow Streptocarpus hybrids in all shapes and sizes, with really striking flower colours and forms, which make very popular indoor plants. Streptocarpus flowers also make excellent cut flowers, especially the long-stemmed varieties, as they last very well in the vase.

Streptocarpus meyeri is a plant that is seldom seen in gardens due to its unavailability in the trade and because it can be challenging to grow in home garden conditions.

Many species of Streptocarpus make beautiful pot plants and garden plants for shady areas, but this species would do better as a pot plant, rather than planted out in the garden. Ensure a warm spot with good light but no direct sunlight, somewhere on your patio or in the house.

Streptocarpus in general are all very sensitive to direct light, and are scorched easily by the sun, but flower poorly in deep shade. Light shade with good ventilation is best for growing healthy plants with plenty of flowers.

Watering Streptocarpus should be done with care. It is very important that the plants should not be over-watered to prevent rotting and fungal problems. They have quite shallow root systems as in nature and they often thrive in very little soil, so allow them to get quite dry between watering. In fact, they like being allowed to wilt slightly between each watering, and they have the ability to recover very well from this. Be aware that severe wilting can be a sign of root rot caused by over-watering, so check the soil to see that this is not the case.

Avoid wetting this plant’s leaves by watering from the base; pour water into the pot’s tray instead, so that the plant and soil can absorb what is required from there, but once the plant has taken up what it needs, discard any water remaining. During the warm summers when they are actively growing, the plants need regular watering, but note that most Streptocarpus ‘rest’ during winter and this slight dormancy will cause them to need very little water during this time, so be sure to reduce the amount given from autumn onwards until spring.

The two main things to remember when growing Streptocarpus, are that they do not like soil that is too wet, and they do not like heat from direct sunlight.

Pruning: the older leaves will regularly die off, especially in winter. In spring they will be replaced with new leaves as part of the normal growth cycle of streptocarpus. To keep the plants looking attractive, regularly remove all yellowing, brown, unhealthy, or dying leaves, by snipping them off at their base. The tips of the leaves also often slowly die back to an abscission line as they get older or when stressed by drought or low temperature or when over wintering. This unattractive tip can be cut off/removed without limiting the growth of the leaf, as it would naturally shed this anyway and continue with new growth from the base of the leaves. Removing spent flowers can often stimulate a second flush of flowers, so nip off each flower as they fade, then snip off the whole stem at the base once the last flower has dropped. Unless you wish to collect the seeds, then leave the flowers to form fruit capsules.

Feeding: do feed regularly during the growing season with liquid foliar feeds or a general fertilizer or a flower-enhancing fertilizer is recommended.

Planting: repot once the plant’s roots appear at the bottom of the pot.

Pests and diseases: the most common afflictions are aphids and mealy bug. Mottled leaves indicate an infestation with leafhoppers or sometimes red spider mite, these sap-sucking insects can spread viruses. White spots on flowers and leaves in combination with buds that do not open, indicate an infestation with thrips. Holes in leaves are most often made by caterpillars. These can all be controlled by either applying a commercial insecticide, or with cultural pest removal methods, or predatory biological pest controls. Sometimes it is as simple as handpicking off the pest, where appropriate, as well as improving hygiene and increasing ventilation.

Propagation: is best done in spring which is the start of the growing season, either by clump division, seed sowing or leaf cuttings.

Streptocarpus can easily be grown from seed. When sowing the seeds, mix a pinch of the dust-like seeds with a small amount of sand to assist with spreading the seeds evenly. Use a well-drained, spongy medium that is not too coarse, at Kirstenbosch National Botanical Garden we use equal parts peat and compost. Cover with a very thin covering of sand, keep out of direct sun, but in warmth, and water regularly with a fine spray. Germination usually takes 3 to 4 weeks, and do not allow the seedlings to dry out. Plant the seedlings into small pots only once they are quite big and strong. Transplant the young plants again into bigger pots when the roots have filled the small pots.

Plants that have grown quite large can also be divided as a method of increasing them; do this in early spring and repot to grow on. When doing division, break multi-crown clumps into pieces, ensuring each has some of the root system and plant up.

Streptocarpus can be propagated from a single leaf and the best results are from leaf cuttings taken in spring and early summer. Select healthy youngish leaves from the center of the plant and cut off using a sharp knife or blade. Remember that the most active region of the leaf is near the base where the growing region (meristem) is present and so this area will yield the best rooting results. If it is a small leaf, insert the cut end of the leaf into a rooting hormone and then into the medium. Larger leaves can be cut into 3 cm strips. Always take note of which way is the leaf cutting should be orientated before dipping into a rooting hormone and place firmly into the medium, but not too deep, as this will encourage rot. Alternatively, cut along either side of the midrib and treat in the same manner. A variety of mediums can be used as long as they are well drained. Sand, bark, palm fibre and polystyrene or vermiculite in different ratios are all suitable. At Kirstenbosch we use 40% bark, 40% fine leca and 20% vermiculite, and 20% riversand. Water the medium well and treat with a suitable fungicide before using. Depending on the species, plantlets will form along the base of the cut within 1 to 3 months.

When the plantlets are well established, the old leaf can be teased out from the medium and the plantlets potted up into a rich well-drained soil mixture, usually between 6 and twelve months. Streptocarpus thrive in a nutritious, well-aerated medium with ample drainage. A mix of equal parts loam, sand, peat moss and well-rotted compost is ideal.

As they do not have deep roots, they often do better in shallow pots. Mature plants can lose their vigor after 3 to 5 years, and propagation as described above, can be used to replace them with younger plants.

Mealybug, aphids and caterpillars are the most troublesome pests of streptocarpus, though none severely. Caterpillars can either be hand collected or sprayed with a suitable poison, aphids can be sprayed, or removed carefully by running a thumb and forefinger along the flower stems- where they usually occur. If mealybug is found on any part of the plant, quickly remove the affected parts and treat with a suitable pesticide. Kirstenbosch has had great success in managing infestations by using Biological control with the natural predators of mealybug.

Fungal infections are also a cause for concern; if fungus is found on any part of the plant, remove the affected parts and treat with a suitable fungicide.

Streptocarpus are usually only prone to pests and diseases when they not being treated or grown correctly, any plant that is stressed is more likely to come under attack. So avoid the following to reduce the occurrence of problems- overwatering, underfeeding, rootbound plants, lack of good air movement/circulation.

"Scientific description of Dryopteridaceae
Ursinia calenduliflora
","Scientific description of Dryopteridaceae
Ursinia calenduliflora
",,"Ursinia calenduliflora is an annual herb, up to 350 mm high, with finely dissected, fresh green, hairless leaves. The flower is a large, bright orange-yellow daisy, up to 50 mm in diameter, and a single flower is produced at the tip of a long, thin flower stalk. The ray florets are sterile and orange or occasionally yellow, with a purple spot at the base. The disc florets are hermaphrodite (contain male and female reproductive structures) and are yellow. There are two different flower forms, one with a dark ring of purple spots around the yellow centre and one with no dark ring.

Flowers are produced from mid- winter to spring, (July to September), depending on the weather; in a year with good and early rains, they will start flowering in July, and if the rain persists, they could continue flowering into late spring, however, in years with little rain, the flowers will be fewer and will be produced over a shorter period. The involucral bracts are free and occur in many, densely overlapping rows, and have conspicuous membranous tips.

","The genus Ursinia is named after Johann Heinrich Ursinus (1608–-1666), a theologian and botanist from Regensburg, Germany, who wrote Arboretum Biblicum. This species is named for its calendula-like flowers, Calendula being a genus of plants in the Asteraceae with large, showy daisy flowers from Europe and Asia, and commonly called marigold.","Ursinia calenduliflora occurs in sandy soil on rocky slopes in Namaqualand, the semi-desert region in the Northern Cape that is well known for its spectacular displays of spring flowers. It occurs from the Richtersveld Mountains to Springbok and the Kamiesberg Mountains.

Ursinia is a genus of annuals, perennials and sub-shrubs of about 40 species, all native to southern Africa, with one species, that extends its distribution into North Africa. Most of them occur in the winter-rainfall area of the Northern Cape, Western Cape and Eastern Cape. Ursinias can be recognised by their large, showy daisy flowers; the thin, dry papery margins of their involucral bracts (which you one will see observe if you look underneath the flower); and their fruit (cypsela) that has a whorl of papery, petal-like bracts at the tip, which looks like a miniature flower and functions as a wing or parachute, and has earned ursinias the common name of parachute daisy. Ursinias are also known as bergmagriet or berggousblom, meaning mountain marigold, a name it shares with many other species with showy daisy flowers.

Other annual ursinias in cultivation at Kirstenbosch National Botanical Garden, include annual Ursinia anthemoides (common parachute daisy), U. cakilefolia (glossy-eye ursinia), U. speciosa (Namaqua ursinia) and perennial species U. abrotanifolia (lace-leaf ursinia), U. chrysanthemoides var. geyeri (coral ursinia) and U. sericea (silver lace-leaf ursinia).

Ursinia calenduliflora is an annual with a short lifespan, it germinates, grows, flowers, seeds and dies in a period of about six months. Annuals have evolved to survive in harsh environments where only part of the year has conditions suitable for growth or where they have to take advantage of short and/or variable periods of rain in an arid environment. Their strategy is to grow fast and set seed while they can and survive the inhospitable part of the year as dormant seeds. To take advantage of the short-lived resources, annuals have to be able to germinate fast, and grow and produce flowers fast and to produce a lot of seeds. This species is from a semi-arid, winter-rainfall area. It germinates with the first rains in autumn, grows during winter and flowers in late winter and spring. The seeds lie dormant during the hot, dry summer period until conditions become favourable for germination and growth return.

Members of the daisy family all have a pappus. This is the modified calyx or sepals, the part of the flower that surrounds the corolla, or petals. The pappus persists after pollination and is attached to the seed. The pappus can be bristly, or feathery, or scaly and usually enables some sort of dispersal of the seed. In Ursinia the pappus is a whorl of papery, petal-like bracts that looks like a tiny flower, and acts like a parachute and helps disperse the seed by carrying it in the wind. The seeds also have a tuft of silky hairs at the other end, which allows them to attach to a rough surface, such as sand.

The flowers attract many insects, such as flies, bees and beetles. The main pollinator is the Bee Fly, Megapalpus capensis. Ursinia calenduliflora has two kinds of flowers that often occur in the same geographical area. Flowers are either plain orange or they have pronounced dark red rings with dark spots at the base of the ray petals. The dark spots attract the Bee Flies that are searching for mates and are fooled by the dark spots thinking they are females. While searching for the non-existent mates, they pick up pollen and transfer it to other flowers, and this enables the plants to set more seed. However, the dark spots also attract certain flower-eating insects that damage the flowers, resulting in fewer seeds. Having both flower forms is a trade-off for this species.

",,"Grow Ursinia calenduliflora in full sun, in a light, well- drained (sandy) soil. They are best planted close together and en masse for maximum display of flowers, or in groups or clumps in a rockery or herbaceous border.

This species is propagated by seed. Treat it as a spring-flowering annual and sow seed in autumn (April–May). In colder climates where frost occurs, treat it as a summer annual and sow in spring after all danger of frost has passed. Seeds can be sown in situ where they are intended to grow, or they can be sown in trays or beds and transplanted into the garden when they are large enough to handle. Use a light, well-drained, weed-free medium, sow as evenly as possible on a windless day and cover the seeds lightly with the sowing medium or clean sand, or rake into the topmost layer of soil. Water gently using a fine spray and keep moist. Seeds germinate rapidly in 3–-7 days.

Prick out as soon as they are large enough to handle, and transplant into a sunny, north-facing bed, in well-drained, composted soil. Mix with other spring-flowering annuals, such as Ursinia cakilefolia (glossy-eye uUrsinia), U. speciosa (Namaqua ursinia) and U., anthemoides (common parachute daisy), Dimorphotheca sinuata (Namaqualand daisy), D. pluvialis (white Namaqualand daisy), Heliophila coronopifolia (blue flax), or Senecio elegans (wild cineraria).",,,"Ursinia calenduliflora is not used in traditional medicine, nor is it widely grown in gardens. It is easy and rewarding to grow and a colourful bedding plant for spring display.","Ursinia calenduliflora has been given a conservation status of Least Concern (LC), which means that it is not threatened.

Asparagus densiflorus ‘Meyersii’,Asparagus densiflorus ‘Meyersii’,,"Asparagus densiflorus ‘Meyersii’ is a neat, upright plant, with a height of between 300–600 mm and a width of approximately 400–700 mm. The plants have a rhizomatous root system with long fibrous roots bearing oval, turgid, creamy-beige tubers all along the side roots, which assist the plant in surviving long periods of drought. The evergreen, almost equally long stems of this plant, emerge at a central point directly from the ground, remaining close together, often become woody and spiny at their bases as they mature.","The genus Asparagus derives its name from the Greek word Asparagos, the name given to the cultivated edible asparagus (Asparagus officinalis) and is possibly derived from a- meaning ‘intensive’ and sparassa meaning ‘to tear’, referring to the sharp spines of many species, or possibly from spargan meaning ‘to swell or sprout’, referring to the plant’s root tubers that are swollen and fibrous, from which they can resprout. The species name of densiflorus refers to the way the small flowers are densely packed along the stem of the plant.

The cultivar ‘Meyersii’ is a trade name, after the nurseryman Meyers from East London, who introduced this compact, erect form into horticulture. These plants originate from a strain of naturally compact wild plants found in the Eastern Cape, which showed a inclination to shorten their branches and so, through selection, were encouraged to form an enhanced cylindrical shape, where the cladodes are smaller and the raceme is condensed to a few flowers.","Gracefully erect, the cylindrical branches which arch slightly at their tip (thus resembling a cat’s tail), are densely covered in bright green, short, needle-like leaves, that give this plant an attractive delicately textured appearance. What appear to be the ‘leaves’ are actually modified stems called cladodes (phylloclades). These linear, flattened structures occur in groups of 3 or more at a node and give the plants its compact shape and form. The real leaves are actually heavily-reduced, bract-like spurs, which can harden to form the characteristic spines found in most species of Asparagus.

Concealed within this foliage and borne in the branch axils close along the stems, very small and sweetly fragrant flowers occur in summer, from November to April. They are star-shaped and glossy, white, sometimes with a light pink tinge, and often prettily displaying their yellow-orange anthers. The fruits appear from March, often while the plant is still flowering, and are spherical berries, 10 mm in diameter. They are green at first, slowly ripening to a showy, bright orange-red, each containing a single, rounded, hard, black seed.

Asparagus is the largest genus within the family Asparagaceae and consists of approximately 200 species, which are distributed throughout Africa, Asia, Europe; introduced in Australia. Currently in southern Africa there are 86 recognized species of Asparagus, which can be herbaceous perennials, woody shrubs or climbers. They are widespread and common but are not often collected because of the short flowering period and the presence of spines that can cause the experience of handing the plants to be very painful. Asparagus densiflorus has many lovely cultivars, the most noteworthy of which are A. densiflorus ‘Cwebe’, A. densiflorus ‘Flagstaff’ and A. densiflorus ‘Mazeppa’.

All Asparagus species have the identifying characteristic of the modified photosynthetic stems called cladodes, and many species have large, sharp spines that cause pain to humans and animals. Asparagus densiflorus cultivars have only very small, insignificant short spines, making them all excellent garden subjects.

When in bloom, the sweetly scented flowers attract pollinating insects, which in turn attract insectivorous birds and reptiles. The berries are eaten by a wide variety of fruit-eating birds, who then disperse the seeds.

The fibrous roots and their swollen tubers store water and nutrients, and allow the plant to survive periods of drought and also enable them to resprout if the stems are damaged in any way.",,"Asparagus densiflorus ‘Meyersii’ comes from the Eastern Cape.

An extremely versatile and hardy evergreen perennial with decorative, finely textured foliage and bright berries, that can be used outdoors in the garden massed as a groundcover, as a feature plant or in containers/pots, even in retaining walls; also on patios and as houseplants indoors. An easy plant for beginner gardeners, as the cat’s tail asparagus is easy to grow and does not require any special care. In mixed borders, as a visual design element, the beautiful emerald-green foliage is used for textural contrast against plants having larger leaves or broader-textured foliage, and as the foliage gives a tropical feel forest, the cat’s tail asparagus looks perfect used under trees, and for the same reason is also very suitable to being used to complement water features, such as ponds. The plants combine well with other shade-loving plants, such as species of Streptocarpus, Chlorophytum, Plectranthus , Scadoxus, Clivia. and Hypoestes. The recommended planting distance is 30 cm apart, depending on the density effect of the design one wants to achieve.

The cat’s tail asparagus grows in any soil and will tolerate some drought and periods of neglect once established, but does look much better in well-drained soil which is rich in organic matter and is watered moderately. The plant’s root system has thick tuberous roots with swollen storage, which greatly enhance their ability to be waterwise.

It looks best when grown in full/dappled/light or semi-shade, but can grow in the sun, although it will then only thrive if kept well watered and fed regularly with a slow release fertilizer. Plants grown in full sun, are more compact and dense, than those grown in shade. If grown outdoors in shade or semi shade in relatively fertile soil, Asparagus densiflorus ‘Meyersii’ will not require additional fertilizer, as they are not very hungry plants in general, but should they not be growing strongly or have a slightly yellow tinge to the foliage, then the addition of compost around the plants, or the use of an organic fertilizer is recommended, to replenish the natural nutrients in the soil.

If grown indoors, select a position with filtered light, no direct light, and each time Asparagus densiflorus is watered, do so thoroughly, then allow the soil to dry out between watering, and water even less in winter, as the plant’s thick, tuberous roots store water and sodden soil will cause the roots to rot. Asparagus densiflorus can be a sensitive plant indoors and will quickly shed its ‘leaves’ if over watered or placed in insufficient light. Indoor plants can seasonally be moved outdoors (bringing them back inside before winter/frost), but should be allowed to slowly become accustomed to the stronger light outside, before being moved to a full sun position. Grown indoors, Asparagus densiflorus will do best if fed with a liquid fertilizer monthly during the flowering period, November to April. Preferably do not feed these plants during the winter rest period.

This plant is low maintenance, as it only requires dead fronds or the occasional old, yellowed stem to be cut away. To rejuvenate the plants, they can be cut back hard, right at the base, after flowering in May or in early spring, in September, before new growth begins. The same can be done if fronds are damaged/broken or ‘burnt’ by frost. Afterwards a mulch of thick compost can be spread around the plant’s base to provide the food support needed for replenishing lost top growth. The plants will produce new healthier, greener foliage after pruning.

The plants are generally and naturally pest and disease free; mites might be the only occasional problem. Leave the plants to outgrow the infestation, or wait for a natural predator to come along and assist. If the damage starts to become substantial, then use a mitcicide, but follow the application and repeat instructions of the product very closely.

Asparagus densiflorus ‘Meyersii’ is most easily and successfully propagated from seed. Division is not as successful in this cultivar, as it is in others. Collect fully ripened fruit, then remove the seeds from the fleshy berries and sow fresh for best results in a suitable sowing medium, keep in a warm spot in an area that is protected from the wind, in light shade, ensure the soil stays moist, but not wet by watering as required. The seeds will germinate in 4 to 6 weeks, the growth from seeds is slow but steady. Fertilize with a liquid fertilizer at regular intervals to ensure flourishing and plentiful growth during the growing-on stage. Prick out seedlings when well grown and repot into a compost-rich, loamy medium. Grow on in light shade, and water regularly until roots are visible growing out the growing container’s drainage holes. Plants can then be planted out into a larger pot or directly into the garden.",,,"Asparagus species are popular ornamental plants for gardens and landscaping, due to being hardy and waterwise, but also for their structural use with their outstanding textural and emerald-green foliage. Asparagus stems are extremely popular in floristry, used predominantly as filler foliage, with Asparagus plumosus being the most widely used.

Some of the roots of Asparagus species are used traditionally as vegetables, and many are used for medicinal purposes. The berries can cause low toxicity if eaten by humans and other mammals, or if crushed, they cause a minor skin irritation that luckily does not last for very long.","According to the Red list of South African plants, Asparagus densiflorus is listed with the conservation status of Least Concern (LC).

A. densiflorus is a declared invasive weed in Australia and has the potential to become invasive in other countries in areas with a similar microclimate, to where it occurs naturally in South Africa.

Paranomus reflexus,Paranomus reflexus,,"Paranomus reflexus is a robust, well-branched shrub, 1-2 m tall. It has leaves of two different kinds: low down on the stem they are dissected while on the upper part of the stem, particularly on stems carrying flowerheads, they are entire. The dissected leaves are 40-80 mm long, hairless, with slender segments divided in the upper half and tipped with red.

The entire leaves are 35 mm long, egg- to spatula- shaped, hairless and reduce in size towards the tip of the stem. The petiole is up to 15 mm long and clasps the stem. The leaf blade turns outwards and the edges curve upwards.","The genus Paranomus gets its name from its unusual leaves. It means illegal, or contrary to custom, from the Greek para meaning beyond or contrary to, and nomos custom or law, referring to the leaves that are different from the normal pattern or out of the ordinary.

The species name reflexus means reflexed from the Latin reflecto, to bend back, turn back or turn round, and refers to the way the flowers bend downwards as they open. This genus also records the infamous clash between the botanists Salisbury and Brown. Brown's name for this genus was Nivenia to honour the plant collector James Niven, but Salisbury published before Brown, so his name Paranomus is the one that is valid and in use today.

A sceptre is a symbolic ornamental staff held by a sovereign or ruling monarch or worn as a badge or emblem of authority. It is a staff topped with various ornaments depending on the country and period, e.g. a globe, a bird, a lily, or a cross. Paranomus species have earned their common name because their flowerheads resemble a sceptre. The first one to be given this name was Paranomus sceptrum-gustavianus, King Gustav's sceptre. Sparrman found it and named it in 1777, and the common name was later extended to all members of the genus.

","Elegant cream to greenish yellow flowerheads cover the bush during winter-spring (Jun.-Aug.). The flowerheads are 80-140 mm long and up to 70 mm in diameter and resemble a bottlebrush. The flowerhead is made up of many individual flowers, each one 30-35 mm long, very slender, and possessing four free perianth segments. Just before the flowers open they turn downwards (reflex). As soon as they have reflexed, the perianth segments separate, releasing the style with its pollen presenter.

The perianth segments can be seen as the mass of curled threads on the lower half of the flowerhead. The pollen presenter is the 5 mm long green tip of the style. The stigma is a tiny groove at the tip of the style. The seeds are released about two months after flowering. The seed, more correctly termed the fruit, is a smooth achene with a ring of hairs around the base.

Although Paranomus species are quite tricky to differentiate, this one is easy to recognise as no other species produces a similar flowerhead. The closest is P. sceptrum-gustavianus, King Gustav's sceptre, which has similar leaves but its flowerheads are smaller and the flowers are shorter and do not bend downwards, and the two species are separated geographically.

Paranomus reflexus grows on sandstone slopes, at an altitude of 1000-2000 m in the Van Stadens Mountains and the Elandsberg, near Port Elizabeth in the Eastern Cape. It is confined to Kouga Sandstone Fynbos, and occurs in small clumps of a few dozen plants scattered through its range. Climate in this region is warm temperate and rainfall is low and falls throughout the year. This species is the most easterly member of the genus.

The genus Paranomus belongs in the Protea Family (Proteaceae). It is a small genus of 18 species that occur mainly in the mountains of the Western and Eastern Cape from the Cederberg to Uitenhage, with the highest concentration of species in the districts of Caledon, Worcester and Swellendam. They are easily recognised by their leaves which vary from dissected to entire, and many species have both at the same time. This is not the only unusual feature of the leaves; they are also strange in that they don't have a distinct upper and lower surface and don't lie flat like most leaves. They also have a very primitive system of veins. In most modern plants leaves have a midrib from which the minor veins arise. In Paranomus the veins fork repeatedly and don't meet up or unite. This type of venation is characteristic of primitive vascular plants. The dissected leaves have a groove on the upper surface and end in a smooth, shiny, often translucent point, and are always slightly curved upwards. Flowerheads are spike-like made up of many individual flowers. The flowers are grouped into fours, each group of four carried underneath a single leathery bract. These bracts stay on the plant for a year or more, becoming like tiny wooden shells and remaining long after the seeds have dropped off.

","Like most other proteas it is a light feeder with a sensitive root system that is adapted to very nutrient-poor soils. It will not tolerate strong fertilisers and manures, but should be fed with well-rotted compost and, if using chemical fertilisers, choose a slow release or apply very low doses. Proteas don't like phosphates (P), so choose a fertiliser that has little or no P in its formula.

Like many fynbos species it is relatively short-lived, needing replacement after 8-15 years. Paranomus reflexus is susceptible to infection by the phytophthora root rot fungus, so care should be taken to keep root disturbance to a minimum; avoid breaking them by not digging around their base inside their drip-line, rather put down a thick layer of mulch once or twice a year and leave them undisturbed.","Paranomus reflexus flowers are pollinated by insects, and are well visited by bees at Kirstenbosch.

Plants are killed by fire and do not resprout but after a fire seedlings usually appear in large numbers. The seeds drop from the flowerheads about two months after flowering and are carried off by ants to their nests where the elaiosome (a layer or growth on the seed that is attractive to ants and usually contains nutrients for them) is consumed. The rest of the seed remains uneaten and unharmed underground, safe from predators like mice, and fire. This method of dispersal is known as myrmecochory.

Paranomus reflexus makes an interesting and decorative garden shrub and is a good cutflower with a long vase life.

Paranomus reflexus so far, is the only Paranomus that survives and thrives in general cultivation in the garden at Kirstenbosch. It is fast growing and easy to cultivate, but requires well-drained, acid sandy soils, free air circulation and a sunny position to do well. It tolerates drought but performs best with moderate water all year round.

Grow Paranomus reflexus in the fynbos garden, water-wise garden, Mediterranean garden, on a sunny slope, in a shrubbery or rockery.

Paranomus reflexus is easily propagated by seeds or cuttings. Sow in late summer-autumn in sterile, well-drained soil. Press the seeds into the surface and cover with clean sand or fine-milled bark and keep moist but not wet. Transplant into individual containers filled with well-drained, acidic soil mix as soon as the first pair of true leaves has developed.

Take semi-hardwood cuttings in autumn or spring. Do not take cuttings from stems with flower buds, we have found that cuttings from the stems with dissected leaves root better than those from stems with the single leaves. Remove the leaves from the basal third of the cutting, treat with a rooting hormone, and place in a well-drained rooting medium under intermittent mist with bottom heat of 24°C.

",,,,"Endangered. Paranomus reflexus occurs over an area of 605 km², occupies only 34 km², and has severely fragmented populations. This species is continuing to decline because its habitat is being destroyed by timber plantations, and invasion by alien plants.",,,,
Gloriosa superba,Gloriosa superba,,"Gloriosa superba is a deciduous, summer-growing climber up to 1.5 m tall, with tuberous roots. The slender stems are produced annually and are upright to scrambling and can grow up to 4 m long. Tubers sprout in spring, and a tuber sends up 1 to 6 stems. The leaves are shiny, bright green and are tipped in a tendril, which will cling to anything it touches. The stems die back in late summer and the tubers are dormant during winter.","The genus name Gloriosa is from the Latin gloriosus meaning ‘glorious’, ‘famous’ or ‘ostentatious’. The species name superba means ‘superb’ or ‘splendid’. This plant was named for its showy ‘glorious superb’ summer flowers.","The showy flowers are borne in summer (November to March) and are usually bi-coloured yellow and orange-scarlet, ageing a deeper shade of orange-red to purple. There is also a pure yellow form. The flowers are borne on long pedicels on the upper parts of the stems. They are nodding, i.e. they are presented up-side-down, with the ovary at the base, the stamens in the middle and the petals at the top. There are 6 free petals, and they are bent backwards (reflexed) so that they are pointing upwards. With their wavy, curling margins, and fiery colours, they really do look like flames. The stamens are large and prominent, and are presented in a ring around the flower, like the spokes of a wagon wheel radiating out around the flower, each tipped with a large anther. The base of the flower is made up of the large, shiny, green ovary tipped by the style, which is bent sharply outwards from the point of attachment at the tip of the ovary, and tipped by a stigma with three short arms.

The colours of the petals in the bi-coloured forms, indicate the stage of development of the flower. The flower buds are yellow or greenish yellow. As the flower opens and matures, the yellow and orange-red colours of the petals develop and deepen. The stigma is receptive for 3 days when the petals show the orange-red tips, yellow middle and greenish base. In pollinated flowers the petals lose the greenish colour at the base, and the top half of the petal remains orange-red and the middle to base is yellow. As the flower ages, the petals become entirely orange-red and the shade darkens. Eventually they wither and turn brown. From tight bud to withering flower takes about 2 weeks. The style and stamens also turn brown and shrivel up, whilee the green ovary at the centre of the flower, enlarges as the seeds develop inside.

The fruit is a large, leathery, 3-valved capsule, taking 6–10 weeks to ripen. It splits to release large, rounded, 4–5 mm in diameter, red seeds, with a thin fleshy outer layer.

In some parts of the world where it was introduced as an ornamental, such as Australia, it has escaped from gardens and naturalised, and is now an invasive weed.

Gloriosa superba occurs in semi-shade or sun in bushveld, coastal dunes, coastal woodlands, forest, thicket, grassland and savanna-forest boundaries, in the Eastern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal, Mpumalanga, Limpopo, North West and in Swaziland, Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe and into tropical Africa, India and southeastern Asia.

The genus Gloriosa is a small genus of about 12 species, found in Africa and Asia. It has recently been expanded to include the former genus Littonia. Three species occur in southern Africa: Gloriosa superba, G. modesta (= Littonia modesta), the climbing Christmas bell or geelklokkie in Afrikaans, and G.rigidifolia (= Littonia rigidifolia). Gloriosa superba L. includes G. simplex L. and G. virescens Lindl.

Gloriosa belongs in the crocus family (Colchicaceae). Other members of this family that are well-known to gardeners, include Sandersonia aurantiaca, Christmas bells, and Colchicum species and hybrids, the many kinds of crocus, native to Europe, North Africa and Asia, and grown in many gardens."," Rhizomes and seeds contain colchicine, isoperlolyrine and related tropolane alkaloids. Air dried rhizomes contain β- sitosterol and its glucoside, 2-hydroxy 6-methoxy benzoic acid","It has not been established what pollinates the flowers, but from the size of the flowers, and the position of the anthers and stigma in relation to the flower and the nectar it produces, it would be expected to be a strong-flying creature with a long beak or tongue, that perches on the flower stalk or hovers beside the flower and comes into contact with an anther and/or the stigma while feeding on the nectar, such as a small, nectar-feeding bird like a sunbird, a butterfly, hawk moth or a long-tongued fly. However, pollination is achieved, the flowers set seed successfully even outside of their natural distribution range.

A study on seed yield in India, found that seed yield in wild plants was low and variable, and that controlled self pollination between flowers on the same plant, gave significantly higher seed yield. Also, that the controlled self pollination produced better results that controlled cross pollination, between flowers on different plants. Looking at any one flower, the stigma becomes receptive 24 to 36 hours after the anthers release their pollen, so that it is unlikely to be pollinated by pollen from the same flower. This study ruled out honey-bees as pollinators as the flowers exposed only to them, produced the least amount of seeds, and established that Gloriosa superba has no genetic self-incompatibility, i.e. fertile seeds are produced from both cross- and self-pollination. It is also noted that the flowers open sequentially so that no two flowers on a branch are at the same stage of development at any time. This adaptation results in low seed yield, but good seed quality.

Grow Gloriosa superba in fertile, well-composted soil in a sunny, semi-shaded or lightly shaded position, and water well in spring and summer. They will tolerate poor soils, but perform better in fertile loamy soil. Allow them to scramble up through shrubs and trees or give them a string or thin-wire trellis to climb. They won’t cling to poles or chunky wooden trellises, and while they are mostly tough and easy to grow, the stems can be damaged and growth halted by attempts to train or redirect them. It is a good container plant. In winter-rainfall climates, keep them dry in winter or grow them in well-drained soil, as the dormant tubers are prone to rotting. Gloriosa superba is tender to frost and in cold climates should be planted out once all danger of frost is passed. It is also suitable for coastal gardens, even those that get salt-laden winds as it occurs naturally in coastal dunes in some areas.

Gloriosa superba can be propagated by seed or division of the tubers. Lift and divide the tubers in late winter while the plants are dormant, but just before new growth starts in spring. Handle the tubers with care as they are delicate and brittle. They are slow to increase by tuber, and should not be lifted more frequently than every three years. Sow seeds in spring. Germination is best at warm temperatures between 20º and 25ºC, but not higher. Remove the fleshy outer coat and soak the seeds in warm water overnight. Use well-drained, sterile potting soil, press them into the soil and cover lightly. Keep the trays moist but not wet. Germination is erratic, occurring in 2 weeks to 3 months, with some seeds remaining dormant for up to 9 months. Seedlings can be planted out straight into the garden or their container as soon as they are large enough to handle, or pot them up and grow them on in the nursery. Young plants grow rapidly, but a plant takes 3–4 years to flower for the first time from seed.","Gloriosa superba is the national flower of Zimbabwe.

Tubers are eaten by porcupines.",,"Gloriosa superba is used in traditional medicine in African and Asian countries and in India, and is farmed for its chemical compounds. It is used to treat a wide range of ailments and diseases in southern Africa, including intestinal worms, haemorrhoids, sprains, strains and bruises, impotence and infertility, as an antispasmodic, and for skin problems, tick infections, to kill lice, disinfect wounds and treat screw worm on cattle. The juice is used to treat snakebite and scorpion stings. Juice of the tuber is also used as a pain killer on a painful tooth. It has also been used as an arrow poison in parts of Africa. In India it is used mainly to treat gout and rheumatism. It is also been identified as a potential anti-cancer drug.

The bright red seeds are used to make decorative necklaces.

Gloriosa superba is a well-known and rewarding ornamental plant, grown in many countries across the world.","Gloriosa superba is Red Listed as LC (Least Concern). It is widespread and common in its natural range and does not face any significant threats.

PLEASE NOTE: that all parts of this plant, both above and below ground, but particularly the tubers, are extremely poisonous, and ingestion could be fatal. The plants contain the alkaloid colchicine. It is a widely used and effective medicinal plant, but incorrect dosage has caused human deaths. Use with extreme caution and only under guidance of a qualified practitioner. Keep the tubers and the seed capsules away from pets and children and do not let the sap come into contact with your mouth or eyes while working with them, as it can cause skin irritation. The tubers are poisonous to grazing stock.

Cucumis metuliferus,Cucumis metuliferus,,"Cucumis metuliferus is an annual climbing or rarely trailing herb; vegetative parts rough with spreading hairs. Stems are up to 3 m long, radiating from a woody rootstock. The leaves are broadly ovate-cordate in outline, up to 90 x 100 mm, unlobed or usually palmately 3-5-lobed, veins below very roughly hairy, margins minutely toothed; leaf stalks (petioles) up to 100 mm long.","The genus name Cucumis is the Latin name for the cucumber which was already cultivated in Ancient Egypt. Cucumis is a genus of ± 32 species, indigenous mainly to Africa, also Asia, Australia and some islands in the Pacific. It includes two major commercial vegetable crops: C. sativus (cucumbers, from Asia) and C. melo (melons, from Africa and Australasia), and two minor ones: the West Indian gherkin (C. anguria) and the kiwano (C. metuliferus). These last two species became cultivated crops outside their native Africa.

The species name metuliferus refers to the sharp spines on the fruit, from the Latin words, metula, meaning a small pyramid, and ferus, meaning bearing.","Both male and female flowers appear on the same plant (monoecious). Male flowers are solitary or up to 4 in sessile or short-stalked groups, greenish to light yellow, the corolla is 5-10 mm long. Female flowers are solitary on 20-60 mm long stalks; the ovary is up to 20 mm long, pale green with numerous minute, dark green fleshy spines, the corolla is yellow, 8-15 mm long. The fruit is ellipsoid-cylindrical, obscurely trigonous (triangular in shape), 60-150 mm long, 30-60 mm across when ripe, the scattered spines are rather stout, fleshy, ± 10 x 2-5 mm, broad-based, deep green-grey, ripening yellow to orange-red with obscure longitudinal stripes of small pale markings and rather softly fleshy. Seeds are ellipsoid, flattened, 6-9 mm long, numerous, embedded in a light green or emerald-green, jelly-like flesh.

Cucumis metuliferus grows naturally in tropical Africa south of the Sahara down to Namibia, Botswana, South Africa and Swaziland. In South Africa it is found in Limpopo, Mpumalanga and KwaZulu-Natal. It has also been recorded from Yemen and is occasionally cultivated in South Africa and elsewhere.

The Cucurbitaceae family consists of about 120 genera and 735 species that are cosmopolitan in mostly tropical and subtropical countries. Many species are cultivated and of economic importance as food plants such as pumpkin, watermelon and also cucumber and melon as listed above. Members of this family are annual or perennial herbs or shrubs (only one species is a tree). The leaves are alternate and variable and tendrils are almost always present. The flowers are mostly unisexual and white or yellow; they occur on the same plant (monoecious) or on separate plants (dioecious). The fruit is often an indehiscent berry (soft-shelled) or gourd (hard-shelled) with one to many, often flattened seeds. There are about 18 genera and 75 species of this family in southern Africa. The family name refers to the pumpkins, Cucurbita species, all originally from the Americas.

Cucumis metuliferus grows at an altitude of 210 m to as high as 1800 m above sea level. Based on the information on specimen labels in the National Herbarium (PRE), the flowering time is from about January to May while the fruiting time is from about February to July. Birds eat the juicy ripe fruits. Hollowed-out shells are often found on the ground; rodents, primates and small antelopes (e.g. steenbok) nibble on the fruit. Jelly melons lack the layer of firm flesh found in cultivated cucumbers, thus containing proportionately more moisture; therefore providing a useful source of water for humans and animals in arid areas.",,"This species usually grows in shallow or deep, well-drained sand, mostly in alluvial soil on river banks, in river beds or flood plains; it is also recorded from clay or loam soil and rocky slopes. It climbs on trees, shrubs or grass in various vegetation types such as forest edges (often riverine), semi-evergreen forest, deciduous woodland (often with Acacia), savanna or grassland. The jelly melon also grows in disturbed areas and abandoned land.

This annual climber can be cultivated easily in a fairly mild climate. Seeds should be planted in their permanent situation in sandy soil and watered regularly. In 1923, Lansdell quoted a South African farmer who cultivated C. metuliferus and who observed that `it is a very heavy cropper, and in my opinion is not as subject to insect pests as the ordinary cucumber.'

In 1981, Parsley advised gardeners to plant a few seeds from a well-ripened jelly melon for a quick-growing cover for an old trellis or compost heap.

Like all cucurbits they seem to be prone to mildew and white-fly. From recent trials in the United States, it appears that C. metuliferus is resistant to the root-knot nematode and also certain mosaic viruses. This is useful when breeding resistance into e.g. C. melo (musk melon, cantaloupe, spanspek).

In the early 1980s, a few farmers in New Zealand started growing C. metuliferus for the local and export market. It was reported that under normal storage, the fruit has a shelf life of six months or more. Initially the crop was sold under the amazing name of `Mexican fruit salad'! Later on the name `Kiwano' was registered as the trademark. Nowadays it is also cultivated elsewhere, such as in Kenya (Van Wyk 2000) and South America.","According to Roodt (1998), in the Okavango the fruit is rather bitter and is seldom consumed by humans except in times of food scarcity, when it is eaten raw or cooked. The Khoisan roast the fruit and then strain the flesh. The leaves are cooked as a spinach or mixed with maize meal. This species is listed by Arnold et al. (1985) as a Khoisan food plant with potential for future economic exploitation.",,"Culinary uses: the fruit needs to be carefully handled because of the sharp spines on the skin. As is the case in C. africanus (March 2005 in this series), the fruits of C. metuliferus occur in very bitter forms, grading to non-bitter forms. The bitter forms are unpalatable and probably poisonous, but there is no way of distinguishing between them except by tasting. The taste of the non-bitter forms has been described as flavourless or rather bland pineapple-banana-like or even ± sour. Some observers noted that the fruit can be eaten like an ordinary cucumber, while Parsley (1981) suggests that the refreshing jelly is best scooped out of the shell with a spoon or used in fruit salad. A jelly can be made from the fruit by boiling it until soft, straining it and boiling the fruit pulp again with a cup of sugar for each cup of water. The fruit can also be cut into cubes and pickled in vinegar.

Medicinal and spiritual uses and toxicity: the jelly melon contains saponin, a substance which is often toxic, but which contains many medicinal properties. Saponin is a kind of oily glycoside that foams freely when shaken with water. Roodt (1998) reports that in the Okavango area, the Shona tribe use a decoction of the root for relief of pain after childbirth. It is also alleged that the boiled root is a very good gonorrhoea cure. Only the bitter forms of the fruit are toxic. According to Roodt, the toxicity can usually be neutralized by cooking the fruits. Elderly persons in the Okavango believe that one can prevent ghosts or evil spirits from entering one's house by pounding the roots, mixing them with fat and smearing them onto the body.","Medicinal and spiritual uses and toxicity: the jelly melon contains saponin, a substance which is often toxic, but which contains many medicinal properties.

Lamiaceae,Lamiaceae,Lamiaceae is characterised by aromatic plants which have been widely used since ancient times. ,"The species of Lamiaceae are mainly herbs or shrubs of various sizes, rarely trees. Life cycles of the herbaceous members may be annular or perennial. The stems are usually square, especially when young, and erect or procumbent (lying on the ground). The leaves are opposite or whorled, decussate (in opposite pairs, with each pair at right angles to the one above and below it), and gland-dotted. The leaves are often strongly aromatic due to ethereal oils located in the glandular hairs. The leaf blades are simple, rarely pinnately lobed (Teucrium) or digitately compound (Cedronella, Vitex), with entire or toothed margins. The flowers are arranged in compact axillary cymes (verticillasters), e.g. in the white Leonotis, or are sometimes single in the axils of the leaves.

Sometimes the inflorescences are congested as in Pycnostachys.

","The family was established by De Jussieu in 1789 as the Order Labiatae. The name Labiatae alludes to the flowers typically having petals fused into an upper and lower lip, the flower thus having an open mouth! Although Labiatae is an acceptable, alternate name, botanists more often use Lamiaceae after the genus Lamium. The family is divided into several subfamilies and tribes of which subfamily Nepetoideae has the most genera. The Lamiaceae is closely related to the family Verbenaceae. However, several recent hylogenetic studies have shown that some genera classified in Verbenaceae belong in Lamiaceae, for example Vitex and Clerodendrum. Salvia is the largest genus of the family, representing ± 1000 species, differing remarkably in their morphology.

Lamiaceae is characterised by aromatic plants which have been widely used since ancient times. The family is known for culinary herbs such as basil, mint, oregano, rosemary, sage and thyme. Members are a source of essential oils for the flavouring and perfume industries, for example the widely cultivated lavender, Lavandula. The Zulu tribe of South Africa calls Leonotis leonurus, utschwalabenyoni, meaning the beer of birds, referring to the copious nectar produced by the plant which is relished by sunbirds.","The calyces are usually persistent with 5 teeth or lobes. Zygomorphic (irregular) flowers are very characteristic of the family. However, actinomorphic (regular) 4-or 5-lobed flowers occur in some genera. The corolla is tubular and typically 2-lipped (bilabiate) with a 2-lobed upper lip and a 3-lobed lower lip, variously coloured and often hairy. The flowers are bisexual, rarely unisexual. The stamens are usually 4 (2 long and 2 short), arising at the corolla mouth or in the tube, and characteristically exserted from the corolla tube (Hemizygia).

Sometimes the filaments are connate (cannot be separated). A superior ovary seated on an entire or lobed disc is characteristic, with the style gynobasic (arising from the base of the pistil) or terminal.

The fruits are composed of 4, or by abortion fewer, dry, 1-seeded nutlets, or may be a drupe with 1-4 pyrenes, subtended by or enclosed within a persistent calyx. The outer surface of the nutlets may be smooth or rugose (wrinkled). Occasionally the nutlets are winged (Tinnea).

Worldwide the Lamiaceae, a member of the seed-forming, dicotyledonous plants, comprises over 240 genera and 6500 species, following the family circumscription of Cantino et al. (1992). The main centre of diversity is the Mediterranean region to central Asia. Members are found in tropical and temperate regions. About 60 genera with ± 980 species occur in the Sub-Saharan African region (Klopper et al. 2006). In South Africa, there are ± 255 species in 35 genera. The species occur predominantly in the summer rainfall areas, but are also found in the winter rainfall areas. The habitats vary to a great extent. The species inhabit not only dry, often rocky, woodland or grassland, but also occur along forest margins and in fynbos.

",,"Many species of the Lamiaceae are attractive to grow in the garden, for example the genus Plectranthus. Leonotis leonurus is grown as an ornamental in various parts of the world. Plants are easily propagated from stem cuttings. Ocimum, an important economic and medicinal herb, requires warmth for growth and should be protected from frost.

Several other members of the Lamiaceae already written about on this site are Plectranthus, Ballota and Salvia.",,,Members are strongly adapted for bird pollination. They are important for providing nectar and pollen to support bee colonies.,"Many species of Lamiaceae are currently not threatened. However, habitats in which they occur are threatened by human impact and thus may change their status in future. Many species are endemic to a restricted area, and are regarded as rare because of their narrow distribution but are not considered as threatened at this stage, for example Syncolostemon macranthus, known from the KwaZulu-Natal Drakensberg between Cathedral Peak and Van Reenen's Pass and just extending into the eastern Free State.",,,,
Mesembryanthemaceae,Mesembryanthemaceae,,"Mesembs are annual to perennial succulents, ranging from minute to compact and tufted to prostrate to decumbent; herbs, dwarf shrubs, subshrubs or shrubs, they are rarely spiny. The leaves are opposite, rarely alternate, simple, free at the base to almost completely united into single, conical to ± spherical bodies, often sheathing the stem. Their shape may be flat to 3-angled to cylindrical. All leaves may be similar (plant homophyllous) or different types of leaf pairs may be present (plant heterophyllous), members of a leaf pair may be similar (plant isophyllous) or dissimilar (plant anisophyllous), heterocellular (with distinct differences in cell sizes) or homocellular (cells of similar size), ephemeral to persistent, with or without bladder cells, sometimes tuberculate or punctate. ","The original name given to mesembs was Mesembrianthemum this name was chosen to describe the opening of flowers at noon. The spelling was later changed to Mesembryanthemum. Historically, the group of plants generally referred to as Aizoaceae have enjoyed fluctuating status in various systematic treatments. Although mesembs are most often classified in Aizoaceae, many taxonomists, particularly in South African herbaria, prefer to treat them as a separate family, Mesembryanthemaceae.","The flowers are bisexual, regular, in cymose inflorescences, sometimes representing the entire plant, to solitary. The calyx is composed of 4 to 6 lobes, sometimes forming a short tube above the ovary. The corolla is composed of many more or less linear petals of staminodial origin, either free or shortly fused at the base. Stamens are numerous, often surrounded by few to many filamentous staminodes. The floral nectaries are either koilomorphic: represented by usually 4 or 5 shell-shaped depressions (in Mesembryanthemoideae), or lophomorphic: raised into a crested ring, continuous or broken into ± 5 crested glands (in some Ruschioideae), or flat, in the more primitive Ruschioideae. The ovary is inferior to half-inferior (in Mesembryanthemoideae), (3, 4)5(-25)-locular; placentas ranging from axile through basal to parietal; ovules usually many; stigmas usually as many as locules (seed chambers), subulate to filiform, sometimes fused at the base, sometimes plumose. The fruit is a loculicidal capsule that splits open when dry or mostly when wetted by means of hygroscopic expanding keels, the fruit is rarely schizocarpic (splits into separate carpels) with winged or nut-like mericarps, or it is fleshy and indehiscent. The seeds are more or less kidney-shaped, glossy to textured, black to brown to pale cream; in the seed, the embryo is curved around the perisperm (food reserve tissue).

Mesembs comprise 127 genera and about 1 700 species, and account for 63% of southern Africa's succulent flora, and almost 10% of South Africa's Flora. The family Mesembryanthemaceae is comparable in size to the New World Cactaceae, also an arid area specialist group. Mesembs occur mostly in the southwestern parts of the African continent, from ± 16° N in Angola down to the Western Cape Province, extending well into the east over the central plateau of South Africa and reaching into Zimbabwe and Botswana. They dominate vegetation in the Succulent Karoo Region. This winter rainfall desert constitutes the world's only arid biodiversity 'hotspot' of the 25 recognized globally. The family is almost entirely endemic to southern Africa with only about 20 species occurring naturally elsewhere. Several species of Delosperma are found from northern Tanzania up to the Yemen and also in the Arabian Peninsula and Madagascar. A few species of Mesembryanthemum occur around the Mediterranean Sea, and most species of the genus Disphyma are found in Australia, New Zealand and the adjacent islands. The genus Sarcozona and some species of Carpobrotus are restricted to Australia, but species of Ruschia and Lampranthus may not be indigenous to Australasia. It is also not clear whether species of Malephora and Carpobrotus are recent introductions to South America, and the populations of Carpobrotus found along the west coast of North America were certainly introduced by man.","The uniqueness and success of the group is attributable to combinations of specialized morphological features that enable survival in arid and in semi-arid conditions. The mostly hygrochastic fruit capsules with rain-dispersed seed are diverse in form and serve taxonomically in the distinction between genera. Succulence and innovative water storage and saving mechanisms contribute to their resilience to drought. In contrast to their close relatives in Aizoaceae, mesemb flowers are characterized by whorls of bright-coloured petals originating through a ""dedoublement"" of staminodial primordia. Flowers are mostly adapted to insect pollinators.","Mesembs show a wide array of succulent morphologies, and succulence is an adaptation to survive seasonal drought in arid environments, although different strategies are evident. In succulent plants, water relations are optimized and prioritized against other factors such as carbon gain. Many utilize CAM photosynthesis, or are able to switch to CAM. Besides low and sporadic rainfall, other ecologically important factors in the life of mesembs include high irradiation, high temperatures, soil salinity and sandblasting. Low temperatures are thought to be a limiting factor in the distribution of most mesembs in the colder interior of southern Africa.",the populations of Carpobrotus found along the west coast of North America were certainly introduced by man.,,"Their economic importance includes traditional uses in soap making, preserves, poultices and preparations with psychoactive medicinal properties, notably kougoed a preparation from Sceletium species. Carpobrotus edulis, known as the sour fig, is eaten as dried fruit or jam in the Western Cape. In addition, the astringent juice of Carpobrotus leaves is used medicinally for sore throats, bluebottle stings and fungal infections.

The main use of mesembs is as garden plants. Their attractive flowers produce colourful displays in spring and early summer. The bokbaaivygie (Dorotheanthus bellidiformis) is a favourite, but many species of Lampranthus and Drosanthemum with their perennial shrubby habits are used in water-wise gardening. Species of Carpobrotus and Aptenia are used as garden plants worldwide. Among those previously described in the Plant of the Week series are Lampranthus aureus, L.affinis, L. multiradiatus and L.haworthii; Drosanthemum speciosum and D.floribundum; Frithia humilis and F.pulchra; Lithops olivacea, L.optica and Conophytum truncatum.","As mesembs are extremely popular amongst specialist succulent plant collectors, a number of them are threatened due to their removal from the wild e.g. Conophytum burgeri, as well as through the destruction of their habitats. Global climate change is seen as the greatest threat to the Succulent Karoo Region, due to the shifting of climatic belts, and the consequent destruction of their mega-niche.",,,,
Pavetta,Pavetta,,"Species of the genus Pavetta are evergreen trees, shrubs or dwarf shrubs, upright, 0.3-10 m high. The bark on young branches is often a light, whitish colour. The branches are arranged in opposite pairs, each pair at right angles to the ones above and below (decussate). The leaves are opposite, each pair at right angles to the ones above and below, rarely in groups of three at the nodes. They are simple, entire, dark green, glossy or hairy, very thin to semisucculent, usually distinctly petiolate. There is quite a variation in the shape and size of the leaves of the different species and this is one of the important characters for identification purposes. On the lower leaf surface, between the axils of the main and secondary veins, there are often cavities or pockets covered by hairs or leaf tissue, known as domatia.","There are two explanations for the derivation of the name Pavetta :

The sweetly scented flowers attract many pollinators such as birds, bees, wasps, beetles, ants and moths. These in turn attract birds and other predators. Birds and monkeys love the fruits, which are obviously distributed by them.

Much research was done at the University of Pretoria on the bacterial nodules. It was originally thought that the bacteria in the leaves fix atmospheric nitrogen, similar to the bacteria in the roots of some legumes (Grobbelaar et al. 1971; Palmer & Pitman 1972). After several experiments, it could not be positively concluded that the bacteria fix nitrogen (Grobbelaar & Groenewald 1974). In other experiments, the seeds were treated with boiling water in an effort to kill the bacteria. Plants that developed from these seeds, showed abnormal growth ('cripples'). This led to another theory: the bacteria produced a growth regulator necessary for the 'normal' growth of the plants (Grobbelaar 1971). Yet another theory is that the bacteria are responsible for the fact that some species are poisonous to stock (Van Wyk et al. 1990).

","It is speculated that these domatia are inhabited by tiny insects such as mites. Black, roundish dots are scattered over the leaf surface or elongated ones along the veins. These are bacterial nodules. On the stem, between the petioles or leaf bases, there are small, connate leaflets (stipules) forming a sheath around the stem, known as interpetiolar stipules, a characteristic feature of the family Rubiaceae.

Many fragrant flowers are borne in terminal, umbellate inflorescences from as early as October to February. The calyx is shortly tubular below, with four, mostly free calyx lobes. The calyx lobes vary in size and shape and are persistent in the fruit. This is another very useful character for identification purposes. Sometimes the calyx lobes are totally absent or only visible as a rim. The corolla is white (in all South African species) to cream-coloured or greenish white, rarely yellow or red in some tropical species, tubular below, with four, free, rounded lobes at right angles to the tube. The lobes have a green apex when young.

Four stamens are attached to the throat of the flower tube, alternately with the corolla lobes and long exserted, initially cream-coloured, turning black and twisted when mature. The style is also long exserted. The upper part is thickened, club-shaped and green initially. Small, shiny, green, pea-like fruits (drupes) containing 1 or 2 seeds, develop from the inferior ovary from about February, turning black with maturity.

The genus Pavetta contains about 400 species occurring in the Old World tropics (tropical and subtropical Africa, Asia and tropical Australia ) but not in Madagascar (Bridson 2003). In southern Africa there are about 24 species, growing in the summer rainfall areas and absent from southern Namibia, the Northern and Western Cape. Most species have small distribution ranges in southern Africa and are endemic to certain areas. They are often found in forests, riverine forests, on forest margins and in bush clumps from sea level to mountain slopes and ravines or more open savannas, whereas some species are almost always associated with rocky situations or with large rocks and boulders.","Much research was done at the University of Pretoria on the bacterial nodules.

Yet another theory is that the bacteria are responsible for the fact that some species are poisonous to stock (Van Wyk et al. 1990).

The bacteria are already present in the seeds. Anatomical studies at the University of Pretoria, showed that bacteria are present in the developing ovaries of the floral buds (Von Teichman & Robbertse 1982; Von Teichman et al. 1982). When the seed germinates, the bacteria can be found in the growth points. Anatomical studies by Herman et al. (1986a) showed that there are special glandular hairs, known as dendroid colleters, present on the inner surface of the stipules enveloping the growth points.

These glandular hairs secrete a mucilaginous substance in which the bacteria occur. The very young, developing leaves in the growth point have already fully developed stomata on their upper surfaces, whereas no stomata are present yet on the lower surface where they normally occur.

The mucilage containing the bacteria enters the leaves through these stomata on the upper surface of the young developing leaves and from there the bacterial nodules develop in the leaves.

They are often associated with the veins. A study of the upper leaf surface of the mature leaves with the scanning electron microscope

and anatomical studies showed a small pore above each bacterial nodule (Herman et al. 1986b).","With their dainty, snow-white, sweetly scented flowers in umbrella-like clusters or balls appearing over Christmas time, bride's bushes should make delightful garden subjects. Any dull area in your garden could be transformed into a bright spot by planting a Pavetta species. Unfortunately, not many Pavetta species are cultivated at this stage. So far, P. lanceolata is the most well-known species cultivated in gardens, followed by P. gardeniifolia and maybe P. cooperi, P. revoluta and P. schumanniana . They will do well when planted initially in shade or semi-shade, but once established, will grow in full sun. The flowers attract many insects and birds and the fruits are also relished by many birds- bride's bushes will attract all these creatures to the garden.",,,,"None of the Pavetta species are threatened at this stage although some are restricted and endemic to small areas, for example P. barbertonensis, P. gerstneri, P. tshikondeni, P. zeyheri subsp. microlancea and P. zeyheri subsp. middelburgensis and should be monitored in future. P. barbertonensis is listed under the Lower Risk category and P. microlancea under the Data Deficient category of the Red Data list of Swaziland by Dlamini & Dlamini (2002).

Two of the species occurring in southern Africa, Pavetta harborii and P. schumanniana, have been reported as poisonous to stock-causing gousiekte (Vahrmeijer 1981). According to Fox & Young (1982) the leaves of P. zeyheri, P. edentula and P. lanceolata are edible and are used as a vegetable. The flowers of some species might be used in traditional, African wedding ceremonies (Smith 1966). Various species have cultivation potential, but only about three or four species are cultivated currently and are not readily available in nurseries. The flowers can be used in flower arrangements.",,,,
Cyperus textilis,Cyperus textilis,,"The stems (correctly termed culms) are 1-3 m tall, and have a tuft of 10 to 25 long, flat, leaf-like bracts that radiate out like the spokes of an umbrella from their tips. The stems are long and rounded, and grow from stolons or rhizomes, forming large clumps. Small branched greenish flowering spikes appear above the leaf-like bracts in late summer. The true leaves are at the base of the plant, reduced to sheaths which clasp the stem.","The genus name Cyperus is from the Latin cuperos or the Greek kypeiros, both meaning sedge or rush.","Cyperus textilis is found in the southern part of South Africa, from Piketberg in the Western Cape to southern KwaZulu-Natal, where it grows along river banks and streams, in pools, dams or marshes, in wet ravines and even in coastal wetlands and brackish estuaries. Many South African place names like Matjiesfontein, Matjiesrivier, Matjiesvlei are derived from the presence of these or related plants.

The sedge family is a cosmopolitan family of grass-like herbs usually found in moist habitats. More than 550 Cyperus species grow all over the world, with over 80 species in southern Africa. The species name textilis,also Latin, means to weave, to plait together or to construct with elaborate care.

Cyperus textilis plants resprout after frost or periodic droughts, in fact, a population can exist for centuries in the same place, sending up new culms whenever there is enough moisture. Their tiny seeds are probably distributed in mud carried by nomadic waterfowl.

Many birds, like finches and weavers, build their nests in Cyperus textilis clumps, and the plants provide shelter for fish larvae, baby crocodiles and various kinds of snakes that live near water. Elephants and hippo often graze to a short turf the plants growing on the edges of waterholes and rivers.","Reed beds consisting of reeds, bulrushes and sedges like Cyperus textilis are used worldwide to clean polluted water and factory effluents. The plants take up the excess nitrogen and phosphates from treated sewage, and have also proved effective in removing heavy metals and phenolic compounds from waste water.","This is a popular garden plant and it grows easily in good garden soil in sun or shade. In bright sun the clumps will be more compact and the stems more closely packed, whereas in the shade the plants will grow taller with fewer stems giving a more graceful effect. It is quite happy growing in shallow water, or waterlogged soil but is equally happy in normal garden soil. It does well in containers or water features, and is a useful plant for waterlogged soil and heavy clay soils. This is a tender perennial, but it will survive outdoors where the winter minimum is -7ÂºC / 30ÂºF (USDA zone 9). Frost will kill the foliage but the plant will resprout in spring provided the roots were not frozen.

Use Cyperus textilis as an accent plant on the banks of ponds, lakes, streams and rivers. In a container it can be used to beautiful effect in a water feature or fish pond. It also makes an interesting addition to the sunny or shady border and is invaluable in a permanently or seasonally wet or boggy area of the garden.

Propagation is easiest by division of the clumps. When dividing a clump, it is best to keep the younger growth from the outside edges and discard the old growth at the centre. Cyperus can also be propagated by seed or by cuttings. Cuttings are made from the top 50 mm or so of a stem, including the 'umbrella'. Some of the leaf-like bracts can be removed to reduce water loss, and the cutting placed in a shallow tray of water or in moist sand. Young plants should arise from the centre of the 'umbrella' and once they have developed roots they can be removed and potted up.","The largest species is C. papyrus, the famous papyrus of Egypt, where it was used to make papyrus rolls until about 8 AD. We grow C. papyrus in and around some of the ponds at Kirstenbosch, where it forms handsome clumps.

Papyrus in pond at Kirstenbosch

Another species grown at Kirstenbosch is C. albostriatus, a forest floor dweller found on the eastern side of South Africa from about Uitenhage to the north of South Africa. This species is small, reaching only 0.2 to 0.5 m in height, and has much thinner, more delicate-looking stems than C. textilis, and prefers to grow in moist, not wet soil.

And we also have the 'world's worst weed', C. rotundus, better known as nut grass, and uintjie or uintjiekweek in Afrikaans, growing uninvited and hated by us and gardeners everywhere.

",,"The culms of Cyperus textilis and other species of Cyperus are used to make baskets, sleeping mats, rolled twine and other woven articles. It is also used in the building of traditional huts, particularly by the Khoi who used it to weave the mats that were used to cover the huts as well as to make a very serviceable rope to tie the poles used to make the dome-shaped framework together. The rope has also been used for binding thatch.

","Cyperus textilis does not suffer from any significant insect, fungal or bacterial diseases.

Lagenaria siceraria,Lagenaria siceraria,,"Vigorous annual herb. Stems prostrate or climbing, angular, ribbed, thick, brittle, softly hairy, up to 5 m long, cut stems exude no sap. Leaves simple, up to 400 mm long and 400 mm broad, shortly and softly hairy, broadly egg-, kidney- or heart-shaped in outline, undivided, angular or faintly 3-7-lobed, lobes rounded, margins shallowly toothed, crushed leaves non-aromatic. Leaf stalks up to 300 mm long, thick, often hollow, densely hairy, with two small, lateral glands inserted at the leaf base. Tendrils split in two.

","The genus name Lagenaria comes from lagena, the Latin name for a Florence flask; referring to the fruit of L. siceraria. The species name siceraria probably also refers to the fruit which is useful when it is mature and dry (siccus).","Flowers stalked (female flower stalks shorter than male), solitary, monoecious (male and female flowers on the same plant); petals 5, crisped, cream or white with darker veins, pale yellow at the base, obovate, up to 45 mm long, opening in the evenings, soon wilting. Fruit large, variable, up to 800 x 200 mm, subglobose to cylindrical, flask-shaped or globose with a constriction above the middle; fleshy, densely hairy to ultimately glabrous, indehiscent, green, maturing yellowish or pale brown, pulp drying out completely on ripening, leaving a thick, hard, hollow shell with almost nothing inside except the seeds. Seeds many, embedded in a spongy pulp, 7-20 mm long, compressed, with two flat facial ridges, in some variants rather irregular and rugose.

It is generally accepted that L. siceraria (previously known as L. vulgaris Ser.) is indigenous to Africa and that it reached temperate and tropical areas in Asia and the Americas about 10 000 years ago, with human help or probably as a wild species whose fruits had floated across the seas. Fruits are known to float in the sea for many months without the seeds losing their viability. Independent domestications from wild populations are believed to have occurred in both the Old and New Worlds. African and American land races (subsp. siceraria ) are morphologically distinct from Asian land races (subsp. asiatica). It is uncertain if the seemingly spontaneous populations in Africa are truly wild. However, it is possible that Mary Wilkins-Ellert discovered an unusual free-living plant of L. siceraria in a remote region of southeastern Zimbabwe fairly recently (Decker-Walters et al. 2004). In southern Africa, L. siceraria has been collected in Namibia, Botswana, Swaziland and the Limpopo, North-West and Gauteng provinces of South Africa. Most, if not all of these collections probably are from cultivated plants or plants that escaped from cultivation.

The calabash has been found growing mainly on alluvial sandy soil and red loam, on flat areas and moderate slopes, on rocky ridges, on river banks and in dry river beds, in disturbed areas and close to the road, often in the shade. It is common in riverine thickets, but also in woodland and savanna with Acacia, Colophospermum mopane, Faidherbia albida and Phragmites. It can also be found in cultivated lands with Sorghum and maize.

The Cucurbitaceae consists of about 120 genera and 735 species that are cosmopolitan in mostly tropical and subtropical countries. Many species are cultivated and of economic importance as food plants such as cucumber, melon, pumpkin and watermelon. Members of this family are annual or perennial herbs or shrubs (only one species is a tree). The leaves are alternate and variable and tendrils are almost always present. The flowers are mostly unisexual and white or yellow; they occur on the same plant (monoecious) or on separate plants (dioecious). The fruit often is an indehiscent berry (soft-shelled) or gourd (hard-shelled) with one to many, often flattened seeds. There are about 18 genera and 75 species of this family in southern Africa.

The genus Lagenaria contains six species, probably all originally Old World and mainly African. Only two species are found in southern Africa; L. siceraria and L. sphaerica.

In southern Africa the calabash flowers mainly in April and May and fruits mainly from April to July. In this region it grows from about 245-1 265 m above sea level, in areas with a rainfall of about 400-600 mm annually. Heiser (1997) observed that the bottle gourd flowers are pollinated at night by hawk-moths and other moth species; by day bumble bees, cucumber beetles and other insects are active. In the Americas hummingbirds are also attracted by the nectar that only the male flowers produce. He also observed that about 40 male and about 3 to 4 female flowers occur on a single plant.",,"The calabash can be grown from seed in frost-free areas. It prefers sandy or loamy soil, some shade, good rainfall or enough water. It can be treated either as a prostrate ground cover or as a climber, in which case the maturing fruit might need some support.","Heiser (1979) wrote The gourd book, devoting more than half of it to L. siceraria. Numerous uses of the bottle gourd in various cultures are discussed and illustrated, even the use as penis sheaths in Papua New Guinea ! Kefalidou (2003) stated that bottle gourds were found all over the Mediterranean as early as the Bronze Age (3 rd and 2 nd millennia BC.). Containers crafted from gourds were in constant use in that region until recent times, as bottles for wine and water, dippers, salt containers, life-jackets (made of gourds tied together), and rattles. Summit & Widess (1999) wrote a book on the rich diversity of musical instruments fashioned from bottle and other gourds in many cultures in various countries. Such instruments are played even today, also in the USA.",,"According to Watt & Breyer-Brandwijk (1962), human poisoning has been reported from eating the fruit, presumably of the bitter form. (As with other members of the Cucurbitaceae, e.g. Cucumis africanus, some plants of L. siceraria produce bitter, poisonous fruits and others non-bitter, edible fruits). Various medicinal uses of the leaves, fruit and seeds have been recorded from various countries, e.g. as a pectoral, an anthelmintic, a purgative and even as a headache remedy.

In southern Africa, the leaves are commonly eaten as a vegetable and are added fresh to maize porridge, or a relish is prepared from them, mixed with other plants. Dried leaves are stored for use in the lean season. The young shoots seem to be an important vegetable, unlike the young fruits that are considered by some to be a famine food. However, in some parts of southern Africa, the young, sweet and green fruit is a popular cooked vegetable, as in many parts of the world. Bitter fruits are not eaten and considered poisonous. Rood (1994) gives recipes for dishes with the young fruit of the calabash as the main ingredient. According to van Wyk & Gericke (2000), a form of small gourd with a coarse skin, is popular in southern Africa as a vegetable known as maranka / maraka, but this is actually a land race of the true squash, Cucurbita pepo.

Until about 25 years ago, South African farmers, particularly from the Ladismith District, Little Karoo, Western Cape, used to cultivate calabashes for the pipe-making industry. The necks of the young fruit were bent regularly in such a way that they grew to form the bowls of pipes. When the fruit was dry and ripe, these necks were sawn off, cleaned and exported to pipe makers overseas. It seems that these calabash pipes became very popular in foreign countries after the Anglo-Boer War, and around 1910 they were sold in the USA for up to 12 dollars. The US Dept. of Agriculture felt that these pipe bowls could be produced far more cheaply locally and in 1909 published a pamphlet detailing the cultivation of the South African pipe calabash and the preparation of these pipes.

In rural southern Africa and elsewhere in developing countries, the calabash fruit is still widely used for various kinds of household containers and utensils. Non-bitter types are used to store water, milk and beer. These calabashes and products made from them are commonly sold as ornaments at roadside stalls and curio markets.

Pedro Paulo Salles from the Univeristy of São Paulo has provided some additional information regarding the use of bottle gourds in Brazil. Here they are known as cabaça, abóbora and porongo (or purunga). He notes that they are used for the transport of foods and liquids and for the construction of a range of musical instruments, some by native tribes. They are also used in cookery, especially in the state of Minas Gerais.","According to Watt & Breyer-Brandwijk (1962), human poisoning has been reported from eating the fruit, presumably of the bitter form.

Vaccinium exul,Vaccinium exul,,"In South Africa the habit of Vaccinium exul is usually that of a shrub or small bush, 1–2 m tall, unlike the plants in Malawi, that grow into trees 4–7 m tall. Plants are single-stemmed, or more usually much branched from the base and frequently coppicing when damaged or burnt in their natural habitat, which is prone to frequent fires. The stems are somewhat angular with few, very short hairs. The bark is grey, pale brown or reddish, sometimes striated.","On a collecting trip of Harry Bolus in 1886, he collected a plant that N.E. Brown identified as the first Vaccinium known from Africa, which was described in 1890. This represented the southernmost member for the genus.

Vaccinium is an old Latin name with uncertain origin. The most plausible explanation for the name is that it was used in classical Latin indicating a plant (possibly the bilberry) and it was derived from the corruption of the stem of the Latin word bacca (berry) which was spelt as vaccinium instead of baccinium. The specific epithet of the African blueberry, exul (exile), was chosen as this was the first representative from Africa and geographically it was far removed from the centres of diversity for this genus and hence alludes to being the ‘exile’ or ‘outcast’ species.","The leaves are alternate, lanceolate to ovate-lanceolate, 30–70 × 9–32 mm, with a serrate margin; the apex is acute or sometimes tapering and the base slightly tapering or rounded; dark green and glossy above, light green sometimes blue-green below, leathery; with a short petiole, 2–5 mm long, which is pinkish.

The inflorescence is a raceme up to 40 mm long and usually hidden amongst foliage, with the pedicels 5–12 mm long. The flowers are urn-shaped, 6–7 mm long, restricted in the throat and with the segments recurved, white to cream-coloured, sometimes pale pink, or with a pinkish tinge, dull- or off-white, cream-coloured or white, rarely greenish, and faintly musky or softly sweetly scented. There are 10 included stamens and the anther has pores on the tips. The fruits are fleshy, succulent, rounded, edible berries, about 7 mm in diameter, that are greenish or yellowish, turning red, maroon, bluish or black, when ripe.

Plants usually flower in early spring and the recorded flowering time is from August to November (specimens in bud recorded for July to September), with successive fruiting from November to May, but mostly in April and May.

Vaccinium exul is found on the Eastern Escarpment in South Africa and Swaziland, with its northern limit a disjunct distribution on Mount Mulanje in Malawi. In South Africa it is restricted to the high altitude escarpment areas of the Mpumalanga Province and on the Soutpansberg in the Limpopo Province.

This species grows in montane areas and along forest and stream margins, here frequently in association with Myrica species. The habitat is usually at high altitudes in areas with low winter temperatures, amongst rocky outcrops and steep mountain grassland, in bush clumps and along afromontane forest and riverine margins. Plants have been recorded from altitudes of 1 280–2 438 m in South Africa, and slightly higher altitudes in Malawi.

In South Africa the African blueberry is mainly associated with the northeastern Mountain Grassland vegetation type which comprises the grasslands of the northern parts of the great escarpment mountains in Mpumalanga and extends to the north and south. These areas receive a high summer rainfall (700–1 100 mm per annum) and mist contributes substantially to the total precipitation. The temperatures range from -8–39°C, with an average of ± 15°C. The soils on the steep rocky mountainsides where it grows, are usually shallow, nutrient poor and acidic. In winter the low temperatures, frost and snow are further important determinants of this vegetation type which produce suitable natural habitat for Vaccinium exul to grow in.

On a collecting trip of Harry Bolus in 1886, he collected a plant that N.E. Brown identified as the first Vaccinium known from Africa, which was described in 1890. This represented the southernmost member for the genus. Today, in continental Africa Vaccinium is currently represented by two species: Vaccinium exul and V. stanleyi. These are complemented by another four species from Madagascar: V. fasciculatum, V. laevigatum, V. madagascariense and V. secundiflorum. Depending on the classification followed the number of species globally ranges between 140 and 500 and are widely distributed, occurring mainly in Malaysia and the northern temperate zone, but extending to the mountains in the tropics, and Madagascar. The genus occurs mainly in the northern hemisphere (tropical America and Asia) with the best-known species there the bilberry (V. myrtillus), the cowberry (V. vitisidaea), the highbush blueberry (V. corymbosum), and the lowbush blueberry (V. angustifolium) and the cranberry (V. oxycoccos), which are mainly utilised for their fruit.

",,"Little is known of the pollination syndromes in the Ericaceae as a whole. In Vaccinium exul, the urceolate (urn-shaped) corolla has a narrow opening, the anthers have pores (rounded openings) at the tips and are positioned approximately at the mouth of the corolla, and the flower produces nectar, all of which is indicative of buzz-pollination.

This species has been successfully cultivated, but outside its natural high altitudinal ranges and specific environmental conditions, it does not fare well. The areas with a suitable climate for the production of commercial blueberries in the Eastern Highveld of South Africa coincide with the areas of natural distribution of Vaccinium exul. Plants will grow well where the mean annual temperature is ±14°C and mean winter minimum and maximum temperature is low, ±3-18°C. In the wild, plants grow in shallow soils with a low clay content and low pH of 3.5–4.5. Simulating these conditions will help in getting these plants to grow.",,,"Although not observed in Vaccinium exul, in general Vaccinium species are used as food plants by the larvae of a number of Lepidoptera (butterfly and moth species). It is a generally important food source for numerous species of mammals and birds.

The baccate (berry-like) fruits are eaten by birds and dispersal is endozoochorous, meaning they are ingested by the birds, the seeds pass unharmed through the animal's digestive system and are dispersed in the droppings.

Although information on the indigenous uses of the African blueberry is almost non-existent in literature, the fruits are edible and tasty, and are suitable for desserts or can be used to produce a pleasant jam. Vaccinium berries are generally utilised as fresh or dried fruit, processed as jam or jellies, preserves used in pastry products, as juice and even in wines, and Christmas decorations, but as the African blueberry is not commercially available because of its restricted natural distribution range it is only utilised locally and mainly by indigenous people.

One of the general attributes of the berries of Vaccinium species is that they are a good source of vitamin C, with very high levels of antioxidants. In clinical studies on animals, blueberries have shown a reduction in the build-up of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, which in turn may reduce heart disease, stroke and atherosclerosis. Further benefits include the reversal of some aging effects, including loss of coordination and balance, improved short-term memory, and some reverse of a decline in motor skills. Whether blueberries will show the same effect in humans, has not yet been tested. None of the aforementioned properties have been tested on Vaccinium exul, which presents scope for further research.

Plants are very decorative. Cultivated plants in a garden will not only be an asset in terms of their structural value and evergreen foliage, but they will surely attract birds with their fruits. Because the plant is adapted to areas with low winter temperatures it will probably not flower or fruit well if planted in areas that do not have similar environmental attributes equivalent to their natural distribution.

","According to the website http://redlist.sanbi.org, checked on 27 November 2015, the conservation status of this plant is Least Concern (LC). However, its natural habitat and vegetation type, mainly Lydenburg Montane Grassland, is considered Vulnerable and regarded to be of conservation importance.",,,,
Oxalis,Oxalis,,"Oxalis, established by Linnaeus in 1753, is characterized by stem-less (acaulescent) or stemmed (caulescent) herbs or sub-shrubs with corms. This genus is the only one of the dicotyledonous genera to produce corms (tuberous bulb-like rootstocks). The species are perennials and low-growing, reaching heights varying from 0.05 to 0.3 m.","The name Oxalis comes from the Greek oxis, which means acid, referring to the sour-tasting sap of some species.","The leaves, borne in basal rosettes, are also characteristic of the genus. They are compound, usually trifoliolate (having three leaflets) with leaflets varying from more or less heart-shaped (broadly obovate and cuneate at the base) to narrowly obovate and predominantly stalked (petiolate). Petioles long and slender. Occasionally the leaves are sessile (without a stalk) or subsessile. The leaflets are often flushed with purple below and maybe hairy or have calli (thickenings). They display sleep movements, drooping or folding at night

Flowers are solitary or in umbel-like clusters on long, erect peduncles (stalks). They are radially symmetric (actinomorphic) with five free sepals (calyx) and a tubular corolla with five lobes (petals).

In some species the tube is long and slender, whereas in others it is rather short or either narrowly or broadly funnel-shaped. Similar to the leaves, the flowers close at night and in dull weather. The lobes of the corolla are prominently twisted in the bud, revealing delicate, glossy, brightly coloured petals as the corolla opens. White, rose-pink, pink, red, shades of purple and yellow are colours observed in the genusO. Oxalis is also characterized by obovate (inversely ovate), broadly obovate or suborbicular (almost with a ± circular outline), clawed corolla lobes.

Ten stamens, in two series, five long and five short, united at the base, and often golden yellow, are characteristic of Oxalis. Pollen grains produced in the anthers display different types. These pollen types proved to be significant in distinguishing different sections and species in the genus. The ovary is superior, 5-locular with five free styles. The fruit of Oxalis is a 5-lobed capsule, much longer than broad, with nearly parallel sides. The seeds, one to many, are explosively ejected.

Species Characters of the inflorescence (type), peduncular bracts, stem, leaves and leaflets (number, shape and texture) are used to distinguish different groups of species in the southern African members of Oxalis (Bayer 2000). A few examples are given of the two main sections below.

Oxalis belongs to the family Oxalidaceae, a family of six genera and about 775 species, occurring mainly in the tropical but also in temperate regions of both the New and Old World. The family in southern Africa is represented by two genera: Oxalis and Biophytum. Oxalis comprises about 700 species world-wide, with centres of diversity in both southern Africa and South America. About 270 species occur in southern Africa. The members are widespread, but are mainly confined to Namibia and the Western and Eastern Cape in South Africa.

Species of Oxalis are mainly confined to the winter-rainfall Fynbos Biome. However, members also occur in the Savanna and Grassland Biomes where rain occurs in summer. The habitats where members of Oxalis are found vary from fynbos, grassland, forest, wetlands, moist, disturbed places, waste places, along watercourses, roadsides, rocky hillsides, clayey or sandy soils.

",,"Members of the genus are propagated by their corms and seed. There are species to suit any situation — good or bad soil, full sunshine or complete shade or semi-shade — and they grow well, provided they get enough water. The plants spread rapidly and can be used as seasonal ground covers, but containers keep growth in check and prevent plants becoming weedy. Many of the species are dormant in the dry season. The genus is not known to be subject to pests or diseases in the garden, but the only reason for this may be that it has not yet been significantly cultivated (Du Plessis & Duncan 1989).

","O. corniculata, a native of Europe, is a troublesome, cosmopolitan weed of disturbed places or is often found along roads, in gardens or in pots.",,"Some southern African species of Oxalis are grown as ornamentals, for example, O. flava, O. lanata and O. purpurea. However, the horticultural potential of these delicate plants still needs to be explored.","The genus needs assessment regarding rare and endangered species.

Van Wyk et al. (2002) reported that ""Oxalis species, for example, O. pes-carpae, and other plants containing soluble oxalic acid, are not really poisonous but they can lead to human and animal fatalities if excessive amounts are consumed. In southern Africa (as in many other parts of the world), outbreaks of oxalate poisoning have been reported, resulting from pastures infested with Oxalis or Rumex species. Under field conditions, sheep are mostly affected, but cattle and horses may suffer from degenerative conditions of the bones after prolonged exposure to low levels of oxalates"". O. pes-caprae occurs mainly in the Western Cape and has become a troublesome weed in many parts of the world. However, the sour leaves of O. pes-caprae are an essential ingredient of waterblommetjie stew and other stews (Van Wyk & Gericke 2000).",,,,
Asparagus asparagoides,Asparagus asparagoides,,"Asparagus asparagoides is an herbaceous, scrambling or climbing, much-branched perennial with twisting, wiry, spineless stems that can grow up to 3 m in length. Roots are rhizomatous and form numerous root tubers. It has decorative shiny green leaves that are not true leaves but phylloclades or ‘leaf-like branches’. These structures are flattened stems that resemble leaves and are 25–40 mm long and 8–20 mm wide. Flowering usually occurs in winter or early spring (July to September). Small, 6–10 mm long, greenish white, hanging, fragrant flowers are borne singly in the axils. The fruit is a globose, sometimes sticky berry, 5–10 mm in diameter, that is red when mature in early summer. Each berry usually contains a few, shiny, black seeds that are egg-shaped or rounded.","The name Asparagus is thought to be derived from the Greek, asparagos, for the cultivated asparagus, which is possibly derived from sparasso meaning ‘to tear’, referring to the sharp spines of many species, or from spargan meaning ‘to swell or sprout’. The species name asparagoides means ‘like the genus Asparagus’, which seems a strange name to give a species of Asparagus, but when this species was first named by Linnaeus in 1753, it was placed in the genus Medeola and in 1808, was moved to the genus Myrsiphyllum, but is now classified in the genus Asparagus.

","It ranges from southern Africa, northwards to tropical Africa. It is widespread and common in forests, bushveld, woodlands, along river banks and in bush, in all the provinces of South Africa and in Namibia, Lesotho and Swaziland.

It has naturalised in parts of southern Europe, California, Hawaii, Australia and New Zealand, and is a listed invasive or environmental weed in some countries.",,"The genus Asparagus contains approximately 200 species, which occur in Africa, Asia and Europe. In southern Africa there are 86 species of Asparagus currently recognised.

This plant can survive drought and frost because of its tuberous roots that store water and nutrients. It produces bright red berries, which are eaten by birds, and other animals, enabling it to be spread long distances.

Asparagus asparagoides is a popular garden plant, and it can attract birds to the garden with its red berries. Best known under the name Cape smilax, it is often used in floral arrangements and in bridal bouquets, and is a popular container plant for home decorating. Roots serve a medicinal purpose as a balm for sore eyes, as a purgative and as a fertility charm for cattle.

Asparagus asparagoides is best grown in semi-shade or dappled shade, although it will grow in full shade to full sun. It is not fussy about soil, but performs best in well-drained, fertile, well-composted soil, with regular watering. Use it as a ground cover, allow it to cascade over a retaining wall or from a hanging basket. It can also be trained up a small trellis. It is suitable for containers and can be grown indoors. Once established, it is moderately drought resistant. The plant can be damaged and appears to be killed by frost, but will survive and resprout in the spring. Likewise, in extreme drought situations, the stems may die, but the rootstock will survive and send out new growth when watered again. When the plant becomes overgrown and untidy, it can be cut back to ground level and it will resprout.

This plant reproduces by seed and spreads by underground stem or rhizomes. Propagate it from seed or by dividing the clumps. Remove the thin fleshy coating from the fruit and sow the seeds in spring or summer, using a general, well-drained, sterile, sowing medium. Keep warm and moist, transplant the seedlings when they are large enough to handle and grow on in light shade. Take note, when dividing a clump, a new plant will grow from a piece of the rhizome, but not from a tuber, ideally plant a piece of rhizome that has a few tubers attached.

","It has naturalised in parts of southern Europe, California, Hawaii, Australia and New Zealand, and is a listed invasive or environmental weed in some countries.",,,"Asparagus asparagoides is not a threatened or protected plant in South Africa, and is , assessed as Least Concern by the Red List of South African plants. In some countries, including Australia and New Zealand, it is an invasive weed that needs to be controlled.",,,,
Erica taxifolia,Erica taxifolia,,"Erica taxifolia is a well-branched, upright shrub growing to 600 mm. Its leaves are longer than most ericas and extend out horizontally (spreading). Its flowers are a showy, strong pink and are produced in clusters at the tips of the branches during mid-summer to autumn (December to May). The flowers are calycine, meaning that the calyx (sepals) is enlarged and coloured and is more obvious than the corolla (petals). The corolla is round to urn shaped, 6-9 mm long. The sepals are long and clasp the corolla, almost covering it. Both corolla and calyx are the same shade of pink. The corolla turns brown quite soon after opening but the calyx retains its bright pink colour. This results in the brown-tipped or brown-centred flowers you will see if you look closely at the flowers as the flowering season progresses.

This species is easily confused with the larger-flowered forms of Erica coriifolia, but they can be told apart by their foliage and calyces: the leaves of Erica taxifolia are long and spreading while those of Erica coriifolia are not; and in Erica taxifolia the calyx clasps the corolla whereas the sepals of Erica coriifolia are spreading.","The genus Erica gets its name from ereiko, to break, either because of the ability of the plant to break up bladder stones or more probably because the stems are brittle and break easily. This species is named for its foliage which resembles that of the Yew Tree, Taxus baccata.

Erica taxifolia was collected by Francis Masson and introduced to horticulture in Britain in 1788. Cleevely, R.J. & Oliver, E.G.H. 2002 report that it was illustrated by Henry Charles Andrews in 1800 in volume 1 of his Coloured engravings of heaths and again in 1809 in volume V of his The Heathery; or a monograph of the genus Erica: containing coloured engravings.

","Erica taxifolia is found typically in rocky habitat on the middle to upper slopes in the Riviersonderend Mountains in the districts of Paarl, Tulbagh, Worcester, Stellenbosch and Caledon. Specimens at higher altitude tend to have larger flowers.

The genus Erica is made up 860 species which occur in Africa, Madagascar and Europe. Of these, 770 species (90%) are confined to southern Africa and most of these are found in the Western and Eastern Cape.

The shape of an erica flower tells us what it is pollinated by. Brightly coloured tubular flowers are pollinated by sunbirds. They are almost always unscented. Bell-shaped and urn shaped flowers are mostly pollinated by insects, including long proboscid flies, butterflies, moths or bees. They are often, but not always, scented.

Wind pollinated ericas can be identified by the clouds of pollen that are released if the bush is shaken and the flowers have large stigmas that extrude far out of the flower. Erica taxifolia flowers are urn shaped and unscented and are most likely insect pollinated. At Kirstenbosch, which is outside of its natural range, on a warm sunny day I saw only a small bee or wasp visiting the flowers, no honey bees or other flying insects.

",,"Erica seeds are tiny and fall out of the flowers, or are shaken out by the wind, when they are ripe. Harvesting erica seeds can be tricky as you have to catch them just before or as they begin to fall.

Erica taxifolia is not widely used in the cutflower trade but is a decorative and long-lasting cut flower. It also makes a decorative garden plant and an attractive potplant.

Growing Erica taxifolia

Erica taxifolia is rewarding and easy to grow. It is particularly suited to fynbos gardens and rockeries, and is also suitable for pot cultivation in a medium-sized container.

Grow Erica taxifolia in a sunny spot that gets some shade for part of the day. It needs well-drained (sandy) acidic soil and free air circulation. Mulch with compost, or plant amongst rocks, to keep the roots cool and weed free. Erica taxifolia will be water-wise in the winter-rainfall area but performs best with a good weekly watering throughout the year. Prune regularly to shape and to remove dead material. Ericas are adapted to poor soils, so feed with well-rotted compost or use diluted liquid fertiliser or small amounts of organic fertiliser. The best time to plant ericas in the garden is during autumn when the weather is cooler and rains will soon start.

Erica taxifolia can be propagated by seed or cuttings. Sow seed in autumn (April-May). Treat the seed with Instant Smoke Plus Seed Primer to improve germination. Use a well-drained, acidic medium. Because the seed is so fine it needs only a light covering of clean sand, or the seeds can be mixed with dry sand and the layer of seed and sand spread in a thin layer on top of the sowing medium. Water with a fine rose to avoid displacing the seeds. Keep the trays damp but not wet and out of direct sun in a warm, but not hot, situation. Germination takes 1 to 2 months. Transplant the seedlings when they are about 10 mm high. Grow on in light shade until they are established.

Take semi-hardwood tip or heel cuttings in late summer to autumn or spring. Treat with a suitable rooting hormone. Place in a well-aerated rooting medium and place the cuttings in a mist unit with bottom heat of 24°C. Pot the rooted cuttings in a well-drained, acidic soil medium and harden off in light shade for a month or two.",,,,"Least Concern, meaning that Erica taxifolia is not threatened with extinction at present.

Mimetes argenteus,Mimetes argenteus,,"Mimetes argenteus is a single-stemmed, sparsely branched, perennial shrub or small tree, reaching a height of 1.0–3.5 m and a spread of 0.5–2 m. The single main trunk can reach a width of about 80 mm in diameter, and branching occurs near the base of the trunk.

A distinctive feature of M. argenteus is its tendency to produce long, straight, unbranched shoots, sometimes as much as a metre or more in length, without developing any side branches. They are occasionally dichotomously branched.","R.A. Salisbury established the genus Mimetes, which is a word derived from the Greek word μιμητής, which translates into ‘imitator, copyist or a presenter of characters as an actor or dancer would’. This is likely referring to the leaves which in shape, size and arrangement, are remarkably like those of some species of other genera. The species name argenteus translates from Latin to ‘silvery, as to tint and lustre’ (Jackson 1979), and obviously refers to the gentle sheen and soft-glowing, silvery appearance of the leaves.

Mimetes argenteus was first described in 1809. However, there is an inconsistency between the collector’s name given in the original description of M. argenteus and the name inscribed on the ticket accompanying the type specimen in Salisbury’s herbarium. Salisbury’s published account of M. argenteus reads: ‘Mr. F. Masson discovered it by rivulets near the river Zonder End’, while a ticket in Salisbury’s hand, attached to the type specimen in the latter’s herbarium, now at Kew, reads: ‘by the mountain rivulets near the river Zonde Einde Niven 72’. It seems that Massons’s name was mistakenly substituted for Niven’s in the published description (Rourke 1984).","Bark of the trunk is thin, smooth and grey. Stems are reddish rose near the tip and are clothed with hairs held at right angles.

Of all silver-leaved Proteaceae in southern Africa, Mimetes argenteus has the most brilliantly reflective, scintillating foliage (Rourke 1984). The leaves are elliptic to broadly elliptic (oval-shaped) and spread out at right-angles from the reddish stems; leaves nearest the tip are shaded with old rose, creating a dazzling sight. Leaves are 40–65 mm long and 18–36 mm wide, having 1 to rarely 3 glandular leaf tips. Leaves are densely silvery sericeous (silky, clothed with close-pressed, soft and straight pubescence) and the margins are sericeously ciliate (fringed with hairs), making the leaves luminous in the sunlight. These colourful, silvery leaves subtend (lay beneath) a headlet of 6–9 flowers. Leaves are brightly coloured with deep carmine to pale mauve during flowering, which occurs from autumn to winter (March to June).

The broadly cylindrical, terminal flowerhead can reach a length of 80–150 mm and a width of 100–120 mm. Floral bracts are relatively inconspicuous in comparison to the leaves, 7–15 mm long, 5–8 mm wide, tightly clasping perianths and becoming woody in the fruiting stage, with the outer surface slightly hairy.

Perianth segments are almost entirely free and symmetrical. Styles are yellow and 40–45 mm long, while the pollen presenter is 7–8 mm long, geniculate (knee-bent) at the style junction and cylindrical with a terminal spur.

The fruit or seed is an ovoid, whitish nut, 7–8 mm long, 5 mm wide, and is either smooth or covered with miniscule hairs. Seeds differ marginally in shape and size between species. Seeds are released 2–6 months after flowering and have fleshy, oily attachments known as elaisomes.

The alien invasive Argentinian Ant (Linepithema humile) also poses a major threat, since M. argenteus relies solely on indigenous ants to disperse and bury seeds underground, whereas the Argentinian Ants simply eat off the seed elaisome in situ and leave seeds exposed on the soil surface, where they are predated on by birds and rodents or burnt by fires. In addition to cheating the plant, this ant also destroys indigenous ant colonies wherever it might settle.

All species of Mimetes are endemic to the Cape Floristic Region in the Western Cape Province of South Africa, occurring nowhere else in the world, and M. argenteus is seldom seen except by mountain hikers. M. argenteus occurs mainly on the moist, southern slopes of the Hottentots Holland, Franschoek and Riviersonderend Mountains, forming a gentle arc in the southwestern Cape Mountains.

The silver pagoda is an exclusively montane species, growing at high altitudes near the coast where it is wreathed in cool, moist cloud mist carried in by the southeasterly winds, allowing it to receive additional summer moisture. The region in which this plant occurs receives over 2 000 mm rainfall annually.

M. argenteus favours cooler sites and is usually found in small populations or scattered groups of few individual plants which can be found growing along the middle slopes, at altitudes between 350–1 400 m in very well-drained situations on coarse, gravelly, heavily weathered Table Mountain Sandstone in association with ericoid and restiod fynbos. Occasionally, populations occur on deeper soils where black peaty deposits, highly acidic in character, have formed in seepage areas, which are well drained.

In drier situations, especially towards the eastern extremity of its distribution range, it tends to be much rarer and even more widely dispersed.

The genus Mimetes is readily distinguished from all other Proteaceae, by the large cylindrical flowerheads. The genus consists of 13 species which are grouped together according to individual characteristics, namely the tube pagodas, the golden pagodas, the cowl pagodas and the silver pagodas. The silver pagodas are defined by their characteristic silver leaves, inconspicuous involucral bracts and horizontal leaves, which are brightly coloured during flowering. M. saxatilis forms part of this group, although it has grey leaves (Rebelo 1995).

M. arboreus is the only other Mimetes species that could possibly be confused with M. argenteus. To compare, M. arboreus has lance-shaped leaves, thicker bark and a dense, rounded crown of repeatedly dichotomously branched stems and reaches an impressive height 2–6 m; it occurs mainly as solitary plants, sometimes as small groves, in the Kogelberg area.

Mimetes are almost entirely dependent on birds to effect cross pollination. Bees, flies and other small hymenoptera may occasionally be responsible for a chance act of cross pollination, but their effective role in this process is undoubtedly minimal.

Nectar is the chief attractant. Nectar droplets are secreted into the perianth tube from four nectaries at the base of each flower.

Malachite Sunbirds (Nectarinia famosa), Lesser Double-collared Sunbirds (Nectarinia chalybea) and Orange-breasted Sunbirds (Nectarinia violacea), are the principle sunbird species feeding on and cross pollinating species of Mimetes, with the latter species of Sunbird being most frequently in attendance (Rourke 1984).

All Mimetes (except M. cucullatus which has a resprouting subterranean lignotuber) regenerate by means of seed, do not resprout after fire and are dependent on myrmecochory (seed dispersal by ants). The elaisomes on the seed are irresistibly attractive to ants, which scatter from their nests within seconds upon detecting a ripe seed, and carry the seed off to their nest where they feast upon the highly nutrient and protein-rich appendage. This could be classified as a mutualistic relationship between the ant and plant since both benefit: the ant has a source of food and the burial of the seeds aids the plant to escape predation by seed-eating rodents and birds, and to ensure protection from fire and underground storage for maturation until the next regeneration.",,"Mimetes argenteus attracts sunbirds and sugarbirds to the garden and would be a beautiful addition to one’s plant collection. Plants are slow growing, but long lived in the right position (Duncan et al. 2013) and would therefore suit the care of a patient and careful gardener.

Anyone attempting to grow M. argenteus must keep in mind that it is a narrow endemic and may grow poorly outside of its natural environment. This more difficultly grown species of Mimetes would be well suited to cooler, misty, coastal or mountainous areas, where natural humidity can be provided (bear in mind that the leaves should not be sprayed with water or wet), and is best grown in a deep container or rock garden pocket.

M. argenteus should be placed in an area where the roots will not overheat on very hot days and receive a natural water supply not treated with chemicals. M. argenteus does not grow well in dry or waterlogged soil and should be planted in well-drained sandstone soil of an acid pH, without any compost, and placed in a full sun or lightly shaded position that is very well ventilated. Since the roots are highly sensitive to soil disturbance and prefer a cooler temperature, an acidic mulch of fine, composted pine-bark or pine-needles is recommended to keep the soil cool in summer (Duncan et al. 2013). Light pruning of the branches after flowering will enhance the shape of the plant and prevent it from becoming too lanky (Duncan & Brown 2006).

Pests: M. argenteus roots are susceptible to the water-borne root fungus Phytophthora cinnamomi. Leaves are susceptible to attack from leaf miner catepillars, which can cause considerable damage to the leaves. Stems are sometimes susceptible to stem-borer which has been noted on a few plants in the wild (Robbie Thomas pers comm.).

Propagation: Propagation of M. argenteus is mainly by cuttings or grafting, the latter proving to be the more successful method.

Seed: Seed germination has proven to be rather unsuccessful considering erratic germination rates and difficulty in sourcing sufficient seed quantities. However, it could be possible to increase germination rates by allowing a two- to three-year waiting period for the seed to mature (Robbie Thomas pers. comm.). Seeds do not respond to smoke treatment and should be sown during Autumn (March to April), after being scarified. Seeds can be scarified by soaking them in a 1% hydrogen peroxide solution for 24 hours. This will oxygenate the seeds by loosening the seed coat, which should then be rubbed off. Seed should be dusted or watered with a fungicide containing the active ingredient Metalaxyl to prevent fungal attack. Seeds can be sown in seed trays, in a well-drained acidic medium. For instance, 8 parts finely milled pine bark and 3 parts coarse sand can be mixed to form a medium (Duncan et al. 2013).

Once seeds are sown, the medium should not be allowed to dry at all. Keep it moist and at alternating temperatures between 10°C and 23°C (Robbie Thomas pers. comm.).

Germination can take up to two months, and seedlings can be planted into small bags once their first set of true leaves has developed. Thereafter, they should be allowed a grow-on period for about one year before planting out into the garden or permanent container. While transplanting, be careful not to damage the roots of the young plant, and do this at a cool time of day, making sure the roots do not dry out.

uttings: Heel cuttings of M. argenteus can be taken from branch tips or side shoots, from young new growth that is slightly firm but also not too soft. Cuttings should ideally be 100–120 mm long, finger thickness, and kept cool after harvesting. Cuttings are best taken early morning while shoots are turgid and temperatures are low. Ensure that secateurs are sharp and cleaned with alcohol swabs before use.

Cuttings are to be treated with a rooting hormone suitable for semi-hardwood cuttings. These must be placed in multitrays or pots filled with a moist rooting medium made of 1 part finely milled bark and 1 part polystyrene balls (the medium should be sterile and treated with a fungicide before cuttings are placed into it). Place these in a well-aerated misting unit with bottom heating of 22–25°C.

Cuttings root well but slowly, taking between six weeks and four months. Check the cuttings regularly and remove any wilted or infected cuttings immediately. A general spraying programme may be necessary to control fungi.

Rooted cuttings must be potted into pots containing a moist medium of 1 part acidic river sand and 1 part composted pine needles or finely milled pine bark. These should be hardened off for three weeks under 50% shade cloth, before being placed in full sunlight.

The elaisomes on the seed are irresistibly attractive to ants, which scatter from their nests within seconds upon detecting a ripe seed, and carry the seed off to their nest where they feast upon the highly nutrient and protein-rich appendage. This could be classified as a mutualistic relationship between the ant and plant since both benefit: the ant has a source of food and the burial of the seeds aids the plant to escape predation by seed-eating rodents and birds, and to ensure protection from fire and underground storage for maturation until the next regeneration.

It has been noted that very few seeds are ejected from ant’s nests once the elaisomes have been eaten. This could be due to the very hard and smooth seed cases remaining once the elaisome has been removed, making it difficult for the ants to grip and carry the seed away, this is a marvelous adaptation to ensure burial of the seed for future regeneration.

Another fascinating adaptation of Mimetes and a few other proteaceae genera is the tendency to release seed in the evening after 4pm—the exact time when ants are becoming most active. This is because ants ignore seed that has withered, dried or where the elaisome is less attractive. This precise timing further ensures seed dispersal (Slingsby & Bond 1981).",,,"Mimetes argenteus is listed as (E) Endangered on the IUCN Red List, since it is facing a high risk of extinction in the wild. Populations are currently decreasing because of habitat degradation, changes in native species dynamics, by invasive alien plant species, and mature individuals are disappearing due to ground water extraction. Too frequent mountain fires are also a threat, since plants are not given sufficient time to reach flowering and seed stage, thus regeneration is impaired.",,,,
Othonna triplinervia,Othonna triplinervia,,"Othonna triplinervia is a brittle-stemmed, succulent shrub from 0.5 m reaching heights of about 1.5–2 m, and evergreen throughout the year. Foliage is light green to somewhat blueish, slightly fleshy, soft, but leathery to the touch. Leaves are obovate (egg-shaped), tapering to the base, entire to scarcely lobed, and crowded towards the tips of the branches, which are thick and fleshy, leafless below the leaves and the scars left by the older dropped leaves are clearly visible.

Flowers are showy, yellow, radiate (like typical daisy flowers), usually with 5 ray florets, on long stalks and produced in loose, many-flowered, terminal corymbs, in autumn and winter (April to June). This plant is not too fast growing, but very rewarding when grown, as it gets more beautiful with age and its stems are upright and give it a nicely rounded shape.

","Its genus name is believed to be derived from the ancient Greek word othonne, which translates to ‘linen’ or ‘cloth’, referring to the soft leaves of some species. The species name triplinervia means ‘3-veined’, derived from the Greek words, triplus, meaning ‘triple’ or ‘threefold’ and nervus, a ‘sinew’, ‘tendon’ or ‘nerve’, referring to the leaves which have three veins from the middle.

","This beautiful plant is found in the Eastern Cape, often growing on rocky slopes and cliffs, in thicket and scrub vegetation, between Humandsdorp, Jansenville and Grahamstown.

The flowers attract bees, butterflies and beetles.

This plant has fleshy, succulent stems, and it can develop a caudex, or swelling at the base of the stem, both of which store water for the plant, allowing it to survive droughts and dry spells.",,"These plants are of no medicinal value, but are used horticulturally for both indoor and outdoor display. When grown indoors in a container, this plant can be placed on windowsills or grown as a natural bonsai specimen in a shallow pot. Planted outdoors, it makes for a great water-wise, rockery, filler or mixed border specimen.

Grow Othonna triplinervia in a sunny position in well-drained soil. It is well suited to rocky sites, rockeries or retaining walls and withstands high rainfall in winter or summer, provided the soil does not get waterlogged. It is water-wise when established. It is probably not hardy to frost.

Othonna triplinervia can be propagated by both seed and cuttings, however, the most preferred method is by means of cuttings, as it allows one to have a mature plant within 4–6 weeks, whereas by seed, it would take three times the period to get seedlings to be of size ready for transplanting.

Sow seeds during late winter or early spring in a well-drained medium consisting of equal amounts of river sand, vermiculite and sifted bark. When sowing seeds, they need to be spread across the medium and lightly covered with sifted bark or sand. When the first true leaves appear, they can be transplanted into small plugs, pots or bags, where they can grow until they are big enough for larger pots. To avoid any pathogens, make use of a soil drenching fungicide when watering both seed and cuttings.

Cuttings can be made throughout the year, but does well when done in hotter drier months, as they often rot when kept in a soggy medium for too long. Cuttings can start from 100–300 mm or even larger, depending on one’s preference. The younger the material the easier or quicker it roots with the aid of an appropriate hormone powder or solution. They do not need a mist unit, preferably place them in a cold frame or a similar controlled environment and ensure that the cutting medium is kept moist, plants are not in direct sunlight, and the air is not hot or dry. As soon as the cuttings have rooted, they can be transplanted into pots or bags, proportional to that of the cuttings, in a medium consisting of 50% river sand, 25% well-rotted compost and 25% sifted bark. Plants are self-sufficient but benefit from a drench of high nitrogen liquid fertilizer.",,,,"According to the Red List of South African Plants, checked on 12/12/2016, the conservation status of this plant is Least Concern (LC).

Pelargonium odoratissimum,Pelargonium odoratissimum,,"Pelargonium odoratissimum is a perennial and relatively flat-growing shrublet with a short thick main stem with extensive herbaceous flowering branches which are 60 cm in length. The plant rarely grows beyond a height of 30 cm. The main stem is coarse and scaly due to persistent bases of old stipules. The roots are somewhat tuberous.

The leaves, 30-40 mm in diameter, are roundish to ovate -cordate with crenulate margins. They are apple green and covered with fine short hairs making them pleasant to touch. They have a strong apple-mint scent.

The flowers are pale pink and relatively small. This species flowers throughout the year except for midsummer.","Pelargonium received its name from the resemblance of the shape of the fruit to the beak of a stork, which is pelargos in Greek. The specific name odoratissimus (Latin), most fragrant, refers to the sweet smell of the leaves. This species was introduced in 1724 into the United Kingdom where it was grown in the Chelsea Garden.","Pelargonium odoratissimum is common in the southern Western and Eastern Cape. Locality records have also been noted from the Lowveld of Mpumalanga and KwaZulu-Natal. It grows as undergrowth in forests or in shaded places protected by rocky ledges or taller bushes.

William Henry Harvey, an Irish botanist, divided the genus Pelargonium into 15 sections. The indicative features for the different sections were based on leaf and flower characteristics and the habitat in which they occurred. Pelargonium odoratissimum is classified under the section Cortusina. This section consists of half- shrubs with fleshy, thick and short stems which have persistent stipules. The leaves are reniform (kidney-shaped) or cordate, silky or woolly, palmately lobed (like fingers on a hand) and are borne on lengthy petioles. The five petals are sub equal, the upper two being broader than the lower petals. The section contains well-known species such as P. reniforme and P. sidoides. People often refer to pelargoniums as geraniums.

The genus Pelargonium belongs in the family Geraniaceae, a large cosmopolitan family of approximately 11 genera and 800 species in subtropical and temperate family found in many regions of the world. The South African genera in the Geraniaceae family are Monsonia, Sarcocaulon, Pelargonium, Erodium and Geranium. There are approximately 270 species of Pelargonium which occur in S, E and NE Africa, Asia, St Helena, Tristan da Cunha, Madagascar, Australia and New Zealand, most of which (± 219 species) occur in southern Africa.

The seed is adapted to wind dispersal; it is light in weight and has a feathered, spiral, tail. When the seed lands and there is sufficient moisture in the soil, the tail becomes like a drill, twisting the seed into the soil so that the seed can anchor itself in the ground and prevent itself from being blown away, or carried away by moving animals.

The essential oils of Pelargonium species that have scented leaves such as P.graveolens , P. tomentosum , P. denticulatum and P. odoratissimum have been found to have good antibacterial activity. The species can also be used for cosmetic, culinary, craft and aromatic preservatives . When gardening with Pelargonium odoratissimum one should bear in mind that it is best grown in a semishaded area of the garden. P. graveolens , P. grossularioides and P. tomentosum are also recommended for semishaded areas . The leaves are very aromatic, making this plant an excellent addition to any scented garden. Kids will take pleasure in the great sensory benefits these plants present. P. odoratissimum does well in containers and small spaces, and can be grown successfully indoors.

",,"Pelargoniums are easily grown, fairly adaptable and most rewarding in any garden. Pelargonium cultivars have been gracing the balconies of buildings and gardens in the northern hemisphere for many years and have been rated as top garden plants. Pelargonium odoratissimum, like most other members of the genus, is easily grown from either seeds or cuttings. Cuttings are propagated at any time of the year but preferably after flowering and seeding. Take semi-mature stem cuttings 150 mm long and apply a rooting hormone to stimulate the rooting. Place the cuttings into a propagation tray with individual cavities. The cuttings are then placed in a cold-frame to root or a cool well lit area. The cuttings will root within 3 weeks. Once the cuttings have rooted, pot into a well-drained potting soil. Feed the newly rooted cuttings with a liquid seaweed-based fertilizer.

This pelargonium is a summer-rainfall species. Seeds are sown in spring, in a light, well-drained potting soil mixture. Spread the seeds evenly in the seed tray and cover them with a layer of clean white sand or fine-milled pine bark. The depth of sowing is usually one-and-a-half times the size of the seed. Water thoroughly but gently and provide light shade. Germination usually takes place within 4 weeks. Pelargoniums grown from seed are generally more vigorous than those made from cuttings. They do, however, tend to take longer to produce flowers. Plants grown from seed will show some degree of variation and if a particular form or variant is required it must be propagated vegetatively, by cuttings.",,,,"Pelargonium odoratissimum is listed on the Red List of South African plants (Raimondo et al . 2009) as Least Concern. The species was considered Least Concern when it was evaluated against the five IUCN (International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources, often referred to as World Conservation Union) criteria, and does not qualify for the categories Critically Endangered, Endangered, Vulnerable or Near Threatened.",,,,
Phylica ericoides,Phylica ericoides,,"Phylica ericoides is a much-branched, compact, bushy evergreen shrub usually reaching 0.6 m with equal spread but older bushes left to their own devices can reach 1 m. Branches are slender with a sparse covering of short, fine, grey hairs. Leaves are lance-shaped to linear, obtuse or nearly acute, and rounded or heart-shaped at the base, 5-8 mm long, closely set, alternate, simple and have a short petiole.
The margins are rolled under (revolute) so that they almost cover the entire lower leaf surface. The upper surface is often rough and usually hairless, or the margin and midrib are sparsely hairy when young. The undersurface is covered with short, fine grey hairs.","The name of the genus Phylica is from the Greek phyllikos meaning leafy, referring to the densely leafy stems of most of the plants in this genus. The species name ericoides means resembling the genus Erica, commonly known as heaths or heathers. Like many fynbos species, Phylica ericoides does not have a generally accepted common name. It is either referred to by its full botanical name, or, because the species are quite similar, they are often, confusingly, all referred to as phylica or hardebos without any distinguishing descriptive prefix.

If one is uncomfortable with the botanical name, it can be translated into English (which is not much different in this case) as ericoid phylica or heath-like phylica or more simply heath phylica. I have seen phylicas called Cape myrtle in the UK and USA, which is very confusing for South Africans, because we know Myrsine africana as the Cape myrtle.

","You need good eyesight, and a hand lens or dissecting microscope to examine phylica flowers. The flowers are very small, 1.5-2 mm long, tightly packed into 4-7 mm wide rounded heads (capitula) at the tips of the branches. The heads are solitary or clustered. Each tiny flower is broadly cup-shaped, and is made up of a ± 0.5 mm deep, hairless calyx tube, ± 0.75 mm long sepals the outer surface of which is densely covered with coarse, curly white hairs, and tiny 0.5 mm long petals inserted on the upper half of the calyx tube.

Each flower also has bracts, those of the outer flowers are leaf-like and surround the capitulum, whereas those of the inner flowers are 1 mm long and densely hairy. Look closely at a flower head and you can see yellowish green, star-like 'holes' in amongst the whiteness-those are the freshly opened flowers.

The older flowers turn brown on the inside as they close up again. Flowers are produced at any time of the year. At Kirstenbosch, they flower mainly during late summer-autumn-winter (Feb. to June). The flowers have a fairly strong honey scent. The fruit is a ± 4 mm long, obovate, hairless purple-brown capsule with a small depressed area on top, splitting explosively to release smooth seeds with an aril at the base.

Phylica ericoides is divided into five varieties based on a number of characteristics. Some, e.g. the variations in their minute petals, are impossible to observe with the naked eye, but they can also be told apart by their size or flower size and by their geographic distribution.

var. ericoides: as described above. var. montana Pillans: from Sir Lowy's Pass in the Stellenbosch District with slender upper branches, longer, more linear leaves and the whole plant is about two thirds of the size of var. ericoides. var. muirii Pillans: from the Riversdale District where the plants are smaller (up to 0.35 m), with slender pubescent branchlets, and smaller leaves (3-5 mm). var. pauciflora Pillans: from the Bredasdorp District where plants are about 0.4 m tall, have very slender branches and small (5 mm long) linear leaves, and smaller flower heads (2.5-3 mm wide) made up of smaller (1.5-1.75 mm long) flowers. var. zeyheri Pillans: from the Caledon District where the leaves are rounded at the base with a sharp apex and the individual flowers are larger (2-2.5 mm long).

Phylica ericoides is widespread, it occurs on coastal slopes, dunes and deep sands from Saldanha to Paarl and the Cape Peninsula, to Port Elizabeth and into southern tropical Africa.


Phylica is a genus of ± 188 species of shrubs and small trees confined to Africa south of the Equator and to a few islands in the south Atlantic and Indian Oceans. Most of them are found in the southwestern corner of South Africa in the Western Cape and Northern Cape where they are often restricted to small areas. The rest occur on the Drakensberg in the Free State, Eastern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal and Lesotho, and into Mpumalanga, Swaziland, Gauteng and North-West, and on Madagascar, Mauritius, Reunion, New Amsterdam, St Helena and the Tristan da Cunha group of islands.

A few species can be found in Zimbabwe, Zambia, Malawi and Mozambique. The phylica that is probably most well known to gardeners is Phylica pubescens, the featherbush or veerkoppie.

Phylica belongs in the Rhamnaceae, a family of ± 58 genera and 900 species spread throughout the tropical and subtropical parts of the world with nine genera and 203 species in southern Africa. Other southern African genera that gardeners may be familiar with include Rhamnus, Ziziphus, Berchemia and Scutia.

Phylica ericoides was featured in Curtis's Botanical Magazine in 1793, plate no. 224. Curtis calls it the heath-leaved phylica, and writes that Miller cultivated the plant figured in 1731, calling it a 'common and long-established inhabitant of the greenhouse'. He also told him that it grows wild around Lisbon covering large tracts of ground in the same manner that heaths do in Britain-but he was sadly mistaken about its origin.

Phylica ericoides is killed by fire but survives by seedlings that germinate after the fire from seed that accumulates in the soil. It is also very drought-tolerant - the small leaves with rolled under margins and hairy undersurfaces help the plant to survive and thrive in a dry, windy environment. Being small reduces the surface area from which water can be lost.

The rolled under leaf margin and hairy undersurface insulate the leaf and create a water vapour trap that keeps the humidity high right at the leaf surface so that the cells are fooled into not releasing water and the plant can keep its stomata open, even during dry and windy weather, and continues to take in carbon dioxide for photosynthesis. It can thus continue normal growth and maintenance under harsh environmental conditions.

At Kirstenbosch the flowers are visited by beetles, bees and butterflies.

Phylica ericoides is excellent for floristry, and is used mainly as a filler. In the cut flower trade it is sold as a 'Cape Green' and is called white phylica, to distinguish it from P. pubescens that they call green phylica.

",,"Phylica ericoides is a rewarding and easy plant in the garden and is particularly suited to gardens on the sandy coastal areas in the Western and Eastern Cape where it needs little care or extra attention once it is established. It is drought- and wind-tolerant forming a neat, ground-hugging, dense, evergreen bush with a minimum of care and attention.

Grow it in a sunny position in well-drained, sandy soil. When planting it in a water-wise garden in the winter rainfall area, plant it during the autumn (Mar.-Apr.) so that it can settle in during the winter and it will be strong enough to survive the coming summer. Phylica ericoides should survive relatively cold conditions and may be hardy to Zone 9 (-7 to -1° C / 20 to 30° F). After 8-10 years it can start to look a bit sparse and should be replaced.

Phylica ericoides can be propagated by seed and by cuttings. Seed is best sown in autumn, in well-drained soil, and germination takes ± three weeks. The bushes don't seed prolifically at Kirstenbosch, and the explosive dispersal mechanism makes it tricky to harvest. Either harvest just before they ripen when the capsules are still closed and allow them to ripen and open in the drying room-remember to cover the tray or the seed will be dispersed throughout the room!-or cover the fruiting branches with gauze (on the bush) to catch the seed.

At Kirstenbosch (Trevor Adams pers. comm.) we rely primarily on propagation by cuttings. Semi-hardwood tip or heel cuttings are taken in spring-summer from new growth produced after flowering and fruiting. Treat with a rooting hormone (e.g. Seradix 2) and place in an overhead-mist unit, with bottom heat of 24-28° C. Rooting occurs in 3 to 4 weeks, the cuttings are given a three-week weaning period and then potted up.

Phylica ericoides is not susceptible to any pests or diseases.",,,,"According to the Red List of South African Plants, all varieties of Phylica ericoides are Least Concern (LC).",,,,
Momordica cardiospermum,Momordica cardiospermum,"Most observers agree that M. cardiospermoides has a disagreeable smell, but a few collectors described the plant as fragrant.","The rootstock consists of several tough spindle-shaped, thickened roots covered with a yellow bark. The several stems are annual, much-branched, hairless, angular, and up to 10 m long. Leaves are short-stalked, compound, up to 120 mm long, deeply cut to the main vein, with about 10-20 leaflets; they are membranous, hairless, dark green above, and paler below. Tendrils are very thin, simple or split in two. Flowers, male and female on the same plant (monoecious), are all stalked and solitary.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        M.cardiospermoides occurs from Tanzania, Malawi, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Mozambique and Botswana down to Swaziland and South Africa where it is found in the Limpopo, North-West, Gauteng and Mpumalanga provinces and in the Ingwavuma district in northern KwaZulu-Natal. Cucurbitaceae consists of about 120 genera and 735 species that are cosmopolitan in mostly tropical and subtropical countries. Members of this family are annual or perennial herbs or shrubs (only one species is a tree). The leaves are alternate and variable, and tendrils are almost always present. The flowers are mostly unisexual and white or yellow; they occur on the same plant (monoecious) or on separate plants (dioecious). The fruit is often an indehiscent berry (soft-shelled) or gourd (hard-shelled) with one to many, often flattened seeds. There are about 18 genera and 75 species of this family in southern Africa.","The genus name Momordica could perhaps refer to the sculptured seeds or the uneven appearance of the fruits, which look as if they have been bitten; the Latin mordeo means to bite. However, Jackson (1990) doubts this explanation. Momordica is an Old World genus of about 40 species, the majority of them in tropical Africa. They are recognised by the seeds that are almost always enveloped in reddish pulp, and by the often prominent bracts subtending the male flowers.                                                  The species name cardiospermoides refers to the resemblance of the compound leaves to those of Cardiospermum (Sapindaceae), the heart-seed or balloon-vine, also a climber. M. cardiospermoides was formerly known as M. clematidea Sond.; once again the species name refers to the compound leaves which also resemble those of Clematis (Ranunculaceae), another climber known as the traveller's joy. M. cardiospermoides is unique in the Cucurbitaceae in southern Africa in having compound leaves.                                                            ","Male flowers are supported by a prominent sessile bract which is 10-20 mm wide, almost semi-circular, hairless, light green, with a few distinct longitudinal veins; corolla yellow to orange with greenish, raised veins outside, a dirty green near the base inside, 15-25 mm long. Female flowers have a rather small bract (sometimes absent), and the corolla is very similar to but somewhat smaller than in male flowers.
The fruit is fleshy with a pink, gelatinous mucilage, and is more or less egg-shaped to sausage-shaped, smooth, hairless, dark green with lighter blotches when unripe, orange-red to scarlet when ripe, warty or bulging irregularly, indehiscent, 50-100 x 25-50 mm. Seeds are many, rose-red turning crimson or dark brown when ripe, each covered with whitish soft flesh, more or less ovate-elliptic in outline, much compressed with a few irregular rows of flat warts or irregularly twisting ridges, about 12 mm long, about 8 mm wide and about 4 mm thick.                                                                        Meeuse (1959) stated that 'the first flowers, male ones, as is the rule among the monoecious Cucurbitaceae, appear in late spring or early summer. Female flowers appear on the same plant usually one or two months later'.",,"This species grows in well-drained sandy and sandy-loam soil, among rocks on granite/gneiss outcrops, also on flat areas, along river banks and roadsides. It will grow in full sun, but prefers semi-shade among trees and shrubs. It is found in various types of woodland, savanna and wooded grassland vegetation and climbs onto all kinds of trees and shrubs, also on hedges and wire fences. Cucurbitaceae consists of about 120 genera and 735 species that are cosmopolitan in mostly tropical and subtropical countries. Many species are cultivated and of economic importance as food plants such as cucumber, melon, pumpkin and watermelon. Members of this family are annual or perennial herbs or shrubs (only one species is a tree). The leaves are alternate and variable, and tendrils are almost always present. The flowers are mostly unisexual and white or yellow; they occur on the same plant (monoecious) or on separate plants (dioecious). The fruit is often an indehiscent berry (soft-shelled) or gourd (hard-shelled) with one to many, often flattened seeds. There are about 18 genera and 75 species of this family in southern Africa.
M. cardiospermoides grows from about 120-1100 m above sea level in areas with an annual rainfall of about 400-1200 mm. Based on the information on specimen labels in the National Herbarium (PRE), the flowering time is from about November to April, but mainly from November to January, while the fruiting time is also from about November to April but mainly in April. Birds will certainly eat the brightly coloured and fleshy ripe fruit.
This species is not discussed in any of the standard horticultural books on indigenous South African plants. However, its natural habitat and ecology can be used as guidelines. It can be grown from seed in mainly frost-free areas, and the young plants should be protected against drought and too much sunlight. As a climber, the stems will need some support to give a showy effect.",,,"In some areas the leaves of M. cardiospermoides are regarded as edible and cooked as a spinach, as stated on the label of the specimen Barnard 211 in PRE, which was collected in Mpumalanga. Another specimen in PRE, Moss BMP678, grew in a herbalist's garden in Botswana, where it was used medicinally. The fresh or dried roots were cooked and drunk for boils. Dlamini (1981) also listed M. cardiospermoides as a medicinal plant as well as a plant with edible leaves in his publication on the Swaziland flora.",,,,,
Lachenalia mathewsii,Lachenalia mathewsii,The flowers have a mild spicy scent and are pollinated by honey bees. ,"Lachenalia mathewsii is an endangered plant that produces two distinctive, narrowly lance-shaped, tapering leaves. The leaves are unmarked, fresh green in colour and covered with a greyish bloom. The inflorescence is a raceme of bright yellow flowers, each flower bell-shaped and held more or less perpendicular to the main stem, with conspicuous green spot-markings near the tip of each tepal. The flowers have a mild spicy scent and are pollinated by honey bees. The fruit is a capsule containing small, hard, shiny black seeds. 

There are no common names recorded for Lachenalia mathewsii, but lachenalias in general are referred to as lachenalia, or viooltjie, a name derived from the squeaky note, suggestive of a small violin (viooltjie in Afrikaans) that is produced by rubbing two flower stalks together and not from any real or imagined resemblance to violets (also viooltjie in Afrikaans). The name would generally be prefixed by a qualifying description e.g. in this case it could be called geelviooltjie (yellow viooltjie). In Europe and America lachenalias are often commonly called Cape cowslips, but this name is a bit misleading, as they don't really bear any resemblance to the wild British cowslips (Primula species).
","The genus Lachenalia is endemic to southern Africa, and is the largest genus in the family Hyacinthaceae, containing ±110 species that occur in Namibia, the Free State and the Northern, Western and Eastern Cape provinces, but with the vast majority occurring in the winter-rainfall regions of the Cape. The genus is named after Werner de Lachenal, 1739-1800, professor of botany at Basel, Switzerland. The species is named after Mr. J.W. Mathews, the first Curator of Kirstenbosch Botanical Garden, who discovered this species in 1923. It had not been collected from 1943 until Queenie Paine and Hertha Bokelmann found it again in 1983. It is now known from only one locality on the west coast of the Western Cape, the rest of its habitat having been ploughed up for agriculture. Nevertheless, since its rediscovery, Graham Duncan, the curator of the bulb collection at Kirstenbosch, has increased the number of plants in the nursery, and seed and plants have been made widely available, so that it is now grown in bulb collections all over the world. Seed is available from the Seed Room at Kirstenbosch.","Lachenalia mathewsii multiplies rapidly by offsets. These are side-bulbs or daughter-bulbs which develop out of the mother-bulb and from which they eventually break away to form separate bulbs. Offsets can be removed during the dormant period and stored until planting-time in autumn. Or a clump can be allowed to develop over a few years, then lifted and divided.

New bulbs can also be produced by taking leaf cuttings, but only the lower portion of the leaf can be used, as the upper part of the leaf is too narrow. Leaf cuttings must be taken from a healthy plant in active growth. Lachenalia mathewsii produces two leaves, so one entire leaf can be used. It can be cut into two cross-sections, each cutting planted ±1 cm deep in a well-drained rooting medium, e.g. equal parts riversand and vermiculite. The cuttings must be kept shaded and slightly moist. Roots and bulblets will begin to form at the base of cutting in about one month. When the leaf withers, stop watering, remove the little bulblets and store until autumn. Whether an offset or produced from a leaf-cutting, plants grown from a bulblet should flower in their first season, i.e. a year sooner than a plants grown from seed.
",,"Lachenalia mathewsii is not only one of the easiest lachenalias to grow, it is also free-flowering, each inflorescence lasts for about 3 weeks and it multiplies rapidly. Growing this lachenalia in a container is the most rewarding and practical way to cultivate it. It makes an excellent pot subject, and is best in at least 20 to 25 cm diameter pots, or in larger tubs or window boxes, where it can be grown on a sunny balcony, or verandah or in a sunny courtyard. It would also do well in pockets in the rock garden, where it can be displayed to great advantage when planted in groups inter-planted with low-growing annuals like Steirodiscus tagetes, Felicia dubia and Dorotheanthus bellidiformis.

But take note: where porcupines occur outdoor plantings are liable to be dug up and eaten and if moles are prevalent, particularly the Cape golden mole (runner mole), it is advisable to line the area with wire-mesh or sink a wire basket into the soil as the bulbs can be lifted by the tunnelling activities of the moles. Lachenalia mathewsii is tender to frost, and is not suitable for permanent outdoor cultivation in regions with a winter minimum of less than -1 oC (30 oF) USDA Zone 10. In cold northern climates, grow Lachenalia mathewsii in a cool greenhouse, in sun or light shade and avoid scorching midday sun.

Grow this lachenalia in a sunny position which has free air circulation. It must have sun to flower well. It is important that the soil be well-drained. Lachenalia mathewsii is not fussy about the pH of the soil and a growing medium of equal parts riversand to loam or fine well-rotted compost (humus) is ideal. Remember to place a layer of stone chips in the base of the container to ensure perfect drainage. The bulbs are fleshy and will rot if over-watered or if planted in poorly drained soil, or if they are watered excessively when dormant. If concerned about drainage of the growing medium, just increase the proportion of riversand to loam/compost. In a garden situation, choose a sunny spot, preferably on slightly sloping ground as the slope maximises water run-off. Drainage in heavy soil can be improved by digging in large quantities of well-decomposed compost (humus) and riversand.

Dormant bulbs should be planted in the autumn, March and April being the best months, as the bulbs become active when the temperatures start to fall at the end of the summer. The roots shoot first, then the leaves. Plant the bulbs at a depth of ±2 cm. Lachenalias enjoy being crowded together and give a better display this way. You should be able to fit twelve to fifteen bulbs in a 200 mm diameter pot. After planting, or when bringing out an undisturbed pot of dormant bulbs, water the pot thoroughly, and then not again until the leaf shoots appear, after which a good soaking once a fortnight is sufficient and better than light waterings more frequently. It is preferable for the soil to be slightly dry than too wet. In the garden, the bed should be watered well in March-April and left alone until the leaves appear and then soaked once every two weeks only if it does not rain.

Lachenalia mathewsii does not require supplementary feeding in order to grow and flower successfully, but it will respond well to judicious feeding. Bone meal is recommended, as is slow-acting organic fertilizer or fertilizers with a high potash but low nitrogen content, all of which can be mixed into the growing medium in moderate to low quantities. A liquid or seaweed based fertilizer with a relatively low nitrogen content can be used at fortnightly intervals.

If a pot is taken indoors, e.g. to enjoy the flowers, it should be put in a light airy spot and watered sparingly. The pot should not remain indoors for more than two weeks, as the lower-light indoor conditions promote lanky, weak growth.

Towards spring, as the temperatures rise again, the leaves will start to go yellow, which is an indication that the plants are beginning to go dormant. Watering must now be withheld completely and as soon as the leaves have withered, the containers should be placed in a cool dry place to be stored during the summer months. Bulbs in the garden can be lifted at this time and stored in a cool dry place. If left out in the garden, it is best that they receive as little water as possible, but they should be able to survive summer irrigation provided the soil is very well-drained.

Propagation of Lachenalia mathewsii is by seed, offsets, leaf cuttings and tissue culture. Seed is best sown in autumn (March to May) in deep seed trays or pots in a sterilized medium of equal parts fine compost or loam, and riversand. Sow the seed thinly to prevent overcrowding and fungal infection, and to allow sufficient room for each seedling's bulb to develop. Cover with a thin layer of sand, and keep moist and shaded. Germination should occur within five weeks. After germination, the seedlings must be kept moist, not wet, and in a semi-shaded position for their first season. They can be moved into the sun during their second season when some may flower for the first time. They should all flower well in their third season. Seed will remain viable for at least five years at room temperature, even longer if kept refrigerated (not frozen). Lachenalia mathewsii appears not to hybridise when grown nearby other species of Lachenalia.

Although we do not propagate lachenalias by micro-propagation at Kirstenbosch, the Vegetable and Ornamental Plant Institute, Agricultural Research Council at Roodeplaat has been doing it with great success for years.",,,,,,,,
Protea coronata,Protea coronata,,"Protea coronata is an upright, rather untidy shrub, 2-3 m tall, becoming a sparsely branched, small tree up to 5 m high. Leaves are upward-pointing, narrowly lance-shaped, green to bluish green, sometimes turning purplish around the flower head, and sparsely covered in long shaggy hairs, giving them a silvery sheen, and becoming hairless with age. Young growth is often attractively tinged red or coppery.

The Protea flower is not a flower but a flower head or inflorescence, made up of many individual flowers grouped together on a rounded base or receptacle. What appear to be the ‘petals’ of the protea ‘flower’ are actually modified leaves known as floral or involucral bracts. Inside the cup of floral bracts are many long, narrow flowers massed together in the centre. Each flower is made up of a perianth of 4 segments, 3 of which are fused to form a sheath. When the flower opens, the fourth falls free, exposing the style. The anthers are in a slight depression near the tip of the perianth segments.

Protea coronata inflorescences are oblong, deeply cup-shaped, 90-100 mm long and 50-60 mm in diameter. The floral bracts are bright apple-green with a dense fringe of silky white hairs along the margins. The flowers are 70-90 mm long, the tips of the perianth segments are covered in white, woolly-cobwebby hairs and the flowers protrude beyond the floral bracts to form the distinctive circular bump at the tip of the flower head.

In some plants the central mass of protruding flowers is pure white, in others it has a black or dark reddish brown tinge (caused by the colour of the perianth segments underneath the white beard), and in some plants there is a dark reddish brown ring around the central mass (caused by markings on the top edge of the floral bracts). Flowering takes place from autumn until spring (April-September) peaking in late autumn and winter (May-July).

Protea coronata is one of the bearded proteas, the beard being the dense fringe of long hairs on the floral bracts. The other typical characteristics of bearded proteas is the way the floral bracts curve inwards, and the bearded perianth segments don’t fall away when the flowers open but remain upright. Because of this, it appears as if the flower heads don’t open, and it is difficult to tell a fresh flower head from an older one. In a fresh flower head the flowers will be clean and white, and more tightly massed. As the flowers open, they puff out and loosen up, and as the flower head ages, they turn more brown and less puffy white. Other bearded proteas covered in this series include P. neriifolia and P. lepidocarpodendron.

Protea coronata is easy to recognize as there really is no other protea like it.

","The genus Protea was named by Linnaeus after the Greek god Proteus who could change his form at will, because the proteas are so different in form. Coronata means crowned, from the Latin corona, meaning crown, garland or wreath, referring to the way the tips of the flowers project beyond the floral bracts forming a white woolly crown at the top of the flower head.

The Proteaceae is an ancient family. Its ancestors grew in Gondwanaland 300 million years ago. The family is divided into two subfamilies, the Proteoideae, best represented in southern Africa, and the Grevilleoideae, concentrated in Australia and South America and the other smaller segments of Gondwanaland that are now part of eastern Asia. In Africa, no species occurs further north than the Limpopo River, and 92% of the species occur only in the Cape Floristic Region, a narrow belt of mountainous coastal land from Clanwilliam to Grahamstown. The extraordinary richness and diversity of species characteristic of the Cape flora is thought to be caused in part by the diverse landscape where populations can become isolated from each other and in time develop into separate species.

Protea coronata was first mentioned in botanical literature in 1720 when an illustrated account of it was published by Boerhaave. It did not attract much attention and was only introduced into cultivation in England in 1822.
","Protea coronata is not threatened. It typically occurs in dense stands and has weedy tendencies in that it often appears on fallow land adjacent to wild populations and along road verges.

Protea coronata occurs in the west, south and southeast of the Western Cape and into the Eastern Cape, in three distinct blocks and with two large gaps in its distribution range. In the west, it occurs on the Cape Peninsula and Du Toit's Kloof to the Kogelberg, Riversonderend, the Bredasdorp Mountains and Potberg. In the middle part of its range it occurs in the eastern Langeberg and Outeniqua Mountains between Riversdale and George. The most easterly populations occur in the eastern Tsitsikamma Mountains near Humansdorp and in the Suurberg. These gaps occur most likely because of its soil and moisture preferences. Unlike most proteas it prefers heavy clay soils and fairly high rainfall. It is found growing in soil derived from Malmesbury shale, decomposed Cape granite, shale bands in Table Mountain sandstone and on Bokkeveld shales. It forms dense stands on the lower or middle slopes between 200 and 750 m, often in tall, moist fynbos on forest margins or in damp, sheltered kloofs. Its tolerance for heavy soils and high moisture make it well suited to cultivation in most gardens. Protea coronata is visited by the Cape sugarbird and sunbirds, and by many insects, including the protea beetle. The birds feed on the nectar while the insects come in search of nectar and pollen. Only the sugarbird and the protea beetle are the pollinators. Nectar is found at the base of each flower. To get to it, the sugarbird has to push its head between the massed flowers to reach the nectar at the base; while doing this, pollen is rubbed off onto the bird’s head. It then flies off to another bush and transfers its load of pollen to another flower while it picks up some more. The protea beetles are large and brush the pollen onto themselves as they move through the flower head.

The sunbirds are not pollinators, they ‘cheat’ by sticking their beaks into the side of the flower heads straight to the base of the flowers, bypassing the pollen. Many insects visit protea flower heads; take a look inside or turn one upside down and tap the side a few times and see how many fall out. Some are pests, damaging the flower or eating the seed, but most are there to feed on the pollen or each other and may also be extra food for sugarbirds and sunbirds.

Fynbos is fire-prone and most plants have adopted a re-seeding or resprouting strategy to survive frequent fires. Protea coronata is a re-seeder, it produces large amounts of seed and although killed by a fire, it is quick to recolonise from seed after a fire. It is also fast-growing and relatively short-lived and is known to be a bit weedy, in that it spreads onto fallow land and road verges adjacent to wild populations.

Protea seeds are covered in long hairs. These hairs aid in dispersal and germination: by expanding as the flower head opens, forcing them out of the head; once they are out, the hairs allow the seeds to be more easily moved by the wind; and once they land on the soil the hairs help to anchor the seeds in to the ground; and finally, the hairs help orientate the seed the right way round and channel water towards it.
",,"The green protea is an interesting addition to the fynbos garden, but is equally at home in gardens outside of the winter rainfall area as it tolerates a wider range of soils than most proteas. It is not the showiest specimen shrub, but its silvery foliage is useful for providing contrast, and its fast growth will quickly provide height as a backdrop. It is a very unusual and attractive cut flower.

Protea coronata is easy to grow in most garden soils, including heavy clay soils, provided they are acidic (pH7) and well drained. It can be planted in full sun or in a situation that is shaded for part of the day, but needs free circulation of air. The more shaded and sheltered its position, the more likely fungal infections will afflict the foliage and flowers. Water well throughout the year but particularly in autumn-winter-spring. Keep root disturbance to a minimum; protea roots are very susceptible to infection so try not to break them by digging around their base inside their drip-line, rather put down a thick layer of mulch once or twice a year and leave them undisturbed. Proteas are very light feeders with sensitive root systems that are adapted to very nutrient-poor soils and will be killed by strong fertilizers and manure. Proteas don't like phosphates (P), so choose a fertilizer that has little or no P in its formula, and give them small doses more frequently, or use a slow-release fertilizer. Protea coronata is fast-growing and vigorous, flowering in its second year from seed and reaching 2 m in four years. It is also relatively short-lived and is best replaced after about 8 years. This species is tolerant of light frost and a winter minimum of -1° C (30° F), and is not suited to very cold gardens.

Protea coronata is easily raised from seed sown in autumn, in well-drained soil, lightly covered with clean sand or fine-milled bark and kept moist but not wet. Germination occurs after about 20-30 days. Treating the seeds with a fungicide increases the number of surviving seedlings. Transplant into individual containers as soon as the first pair of true leaves have developed. Seedlings are vigorous and fast-growing, and the first flowers can be expected in their second year.

It can also be propagated by semi-hardwood cuttings taken from the current season’s growth, in autumn or spring. Remove the leaves from the basal third of the cutting, treat with a rooting hormone, and place in a well-drained rooting medium under intermittent mist with bottom heat of 25° C.

Cleretum belidiforme,Cleretum belidiforme,,"This winter-growing, succulent annual, forms a low groundcover with several spreading branches. The green or maroon-tinted leaves are tongue- or spoon-shaped and more or less flat, with conspicuous raised, bladder-like, surface cells modified for water storage, which glisten in bright sunlight.

The slender, upright or leaning flower stalks are fleshy, grow up to 25 mm long and emerge from the branch tips. Numerous large, solitary, brightly coloured flowers, 20–30 mm in diameter, are produced, each having many, narrowly lance-shaped petals, which open widely in bright sunlight.

Petal colour is very variable, including white, cream-coloured, yellow, salmon-coloured, orange, pink, mauve, magenta or red, sometimes with contrasting white, maroon, yellow or light orange bases. The stamens are clustered together in the centre of the flower in 2 to 4 rows and have maroon filaments with purple or yellow anthers. The ovary is inferior, meaning that it appears below the stamens, and the ripe fruit is a capsule with expanding membranes, which bend outwards in wet weather. The flattened, 5-sided capsules are hard and dry when ripe, and comprise 5 compartments. The minute, irregularly shaped seeds are light brownish cream-coloured, with smooth surfaces.

Cleretum bellidiforme is not threatened and according to the Red List of South African plants, consulted on 26 July 2017, it is assessed as Least Concern (LC).
","The genus Cleretum was established by the English plant taxonomist N.E. Brown in volume 78 (series 3) of The Gardener’s Chronicle in 1925, in an article titled ‘Mesembryanthemum and some new genera separated from it’, however, the meaning of the name is unclear; Cleretum is derived from the Greek kleros, an item used in drawing lots for land in Spartan times, i.e. a pebble, a potsherd or a piece of wood, and the Latin ending –etum, refers to the place dominated by a given plant. The specific name bellidiforme is descriptive of its likeness to flowers of the European daisy genus Bellis, meaning ‘handsome’. The common name bokbaaivygie commemorates the farm Bokbaai (Buck Bay) near Darling on the Cape west coast, where this species occurs commonly, which was owned by the Duckitt family for generations.

The Dutch botanist Nicolaas L. Burmann (1733–1793) initially described this species as Mesembryanthemum bellidiforme in his Prodromus florae capensis, published in Amsterdam in 1768. In 1928, N.E. Brown placed it in the genus Dorotheanthus as D. bellidiformis, a name by which it became very well known, but in 1979, the English botanist Gordon Rowley transferred it to the genus Cleretum, as C. bellidiforme in the horticultural taxonomy journal Baileya. From the early to mid- 20th century, various botanists, primarily Louisa Bolus at the University of Cape Town, described numerous species of Dorotheanthus, including D. acuminatus, D. bidouwensis, D. flos-solis, D. hallii, D. littlewoodii, D. lutens, D. muirii, D. oculatus var. oculatus, D. oculatus var. saldanensis and D. stayneri, however, all these taxa were subsequently regarded as synonyms of D. bellidiformis when the German botanists H.-D. Ihlenfeldt and M. Struck placed Cleretum in synonymy under Dorotheanthus, in 1987. In 2012, the University of Cape Town botanists Cornelia Klak and Peter Bruyns published a molecular phylogeny of the tribe Dorotheantheae (a study of its evolutionary development and diversification, based on DNA analysis) in which it was shown that Dorotheanthus was best placed within the genus Cleretum, thus D. bellidiformis became Cleretum bellidiforme once again; among several other taxonomic changes they made, the purple- or white-flowered Dorotheanthus bellidiformis subsp. hestermalensis from Namaqualand, was renamed Cleretum hestermalense.
","Cleretum bellidiforme is widely distributed in the Fynbos and Succulent Karoo Biomes in the winter rainfall area of the Western and Northern Cape, from Namaqualand to the Cape Peninsula, eastwards to Riversdale in the southern Cape and inland to Laingsburg and Calvinia along the southern and western fringes of the Great Karoo, respectively. It occurs in numerous vegetation types, including Bokkeveld Sandstone Fynbos, Vanrhynsdorp Gannabosveld, Cape Flats Dune Strandveld, Breede Shale Renosterveld and Saldanha Limestone Strandveld, and is most commonly seen on open, sandy flats, but also favours gravelly clay slopes, limestone ridges and humus-rich soil on granite outcrops. It grows as scattered, solitary individuals or in small to large colonies, sometimes in close association with low-growing geophytes and annuals, such as species of Oxalis and Senecio, respectively. It is suited to cultivation in low humidity, frost-free environments.

Comprising 14 species of succulent annuals, Cleretum is endemic to the western, southwestern and southern winter rainfall parts of South Africa. Its distribution extends from Namaqualand to the southern Cape and inland to the western and southern Great Karoo, and its 2 main centres of diversity are in the Kamiesberg in southcentral Namaqualand and the coastal southwestern part of the Western Cape. Cleretum also includes the genus Aethephyllum, and is the sole member of the tribe Dorotheantheae. Eight of the fourteen species of Cleretum have large, flamboyant flowers, whereas 6 have small, rather insignificant ones; C. bellidiforme is by far the most familiar species and one of the most attractive. In the horticultural trade it is still often referred to as ‘Mesembryanthemum’.The leaves are succulent and covered with raised, bladder-like surface cells which store water to nourish the plant during dry periods.

The flowers only open fully on warm, sunny days, remaining closed in cold or rainy weather. The flowers are self-fertile, but are visited by numerous insects which feed on the pollen, including monkey beetles, honey bees, drone flies and small, black, bee-flies.
",,"Cleretum bellidiforme is a winter-growing annual adapted to cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers. The seeds germinate after the first autumn rains, followed by rapid vegetative growth in winter, and the plants flower from early to late spring (early August to mid-October, with a peak in September). 

The seed capsules ripen in summer, during which the seeds remain hidden within the hard and dry, closed capsules. The capsules are almost completely covered by membranes, with only a narrow opening between the membranes. Seed dispersal in these plants is termed ombrohydrochorous, meaning that it is activated by rain drops. The rain drops fall onto the covering membranes, resulting in them bending outwards and the seeds being forcefully ejected some distance from the plant, timed to coincide with autumn rains. As soon as dry weather returns, the membranes bend inwards to cover the remaining seeds. This mechanism ensures that the seeds germinate at the optimum time of year in autumn and early winter, and that they are protected from predators during the hot summer months. Only some of the seeds are released per rainy spell, thus preserving a reservoir of seeds.

Bokbaaivygies are excellent spring-flowering annuals for mass display. These mat-forming plants ideally require sun all day, but will also perform well in full morning or afternoon sun. They are especially well suited to rock garden pockets, slopes and annual borders, or grown in soil-filled cracks between paving slabs and in dry stone walls. They can also be cultivated in window boxes, or in troughs and pots on a sunny patio, and are ideal for seaside gardens and small gardens. Flowering commences in early August and ends in early October, with a peak in September. They are effectively displayed when inter-planted with low-growing, spring-flowering bulbs and annuals, such as bright yellow Sparaxis grandiflora subsp. acutiloba and orange, white, red or yellow Nemesia strumosa, and low-growing perennials, such as Agathosma ciliaris. Bokbaaivygies can be grown in any well-drained soil, but perform best in fertile media containing well-rotted compost. They are propagated from seed sown from early to mid-autumn (March to April), and germination takes place within 7–14 days. Sow the seeds directly onto open ground and cover lightly, or alternatively sow in deep seed trays and plant out seedlings 15 cm apart, once large enough to handle. Keep well watered until the plants are established, thereafter only occasional heavy watering is necessary in winter and spring. The plants can take light frost for periods of a few hours. In ideal conditions, this species often seeds itself from year to year.

The leaves are relished by the European brown garden snail (Cornu aspersa), and if grown in insufficiently well-drained soil, the roots may succumb to fungal attack.
",,,"This species has no traditional, economic or magical uses, but it is grown worldwide as a spring-flowering ornamental.

Gardenia thunbergia,Gardenia thunbergia,,"This is an evergreen shrub or small tree, 2 to 5 m in height, with a smooth, whitish, usually straight main stem up to 250 to 300 mm in diameter, and short, rigid branchlets. The leaves are carried in whorls of 3 or 4 crowded near the ends of the branchlets. They are a glossy light green, hairless, softly to thinly leathery and conspicuously veined. Simple with an entire, wavy margin, variable in size, up to 140 x 60 mm but usually smaller, mostly oval, tapering abruptly to a rounded or blunt tip while the base tapers onto the stalk.

The flowers are large, showy, creamy white and heavily perfumed, particularly at night. They open from elegantly furled creamy-green buds. The flowers do not turn yellow as they age on the bush. The corolla is a 70-120 mm tube with 8 large lobes spreading to ± 80 mm in diameter. Flowers are produced abundantly during summer (October to March), peaking in late summer (January to March).

The fruits are hard and woody, and heavily fibrous inside, and where not being browsed by large antelope, can remain on the bush for years. Each fruit is egg-shaped, greyish green, 50-75 x 35 mm, when mature roughly dotted with whitish encrustations.

Rare in the Cape; Not Threatened in KwaZulu-Natal; Insufficiently Known in Swaziland; Global Status: Not Threatened
","The genus Gardenia was named in honour of Dr Alexander Garden (1730-1971) a Scottish physician who practised in South Carolina, USA, and a correspondent of Linnaeus. This species was named after Carl Thunberg, pupil of Linnaeus and a well-known 18th century botanist and traveller in South Africa.
The Afrikaans common name buffelsbal means buffalo testicles, a reference to the shape of the fruit. The Zulu name umvalasangweni means the back-gate closer and refers to the fact that it and other spiny shrubs and trees are used as the gates for cattle kraals.

Gardenia thunbergia was the first of the South African gardenias to be known to botanists, and was introduced to the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew in London, in 1773.

The gardenia family (Rubiaceae) is a large, cosmopolitan family containing 630 genera and 10 200 species. This family's greatest claim to fame is the South American quinine tree, Cinchona, whose bark yields quinine, the first drug ever used to treat malaria. Coffee, Coffea arabica, is also a member of this family. In South Africa, the family is best known for its decorative flowering trees and shrubs: Gardenia, Rothmannia, Hyperacanthus, Alberta and Burchellia.

The genus Gardenia consists of approximately 60 species that occur in tropical and warm parts of the Old World. Six species are found in South Africa, in all provinces except the Northern and Western Cape. Gardenia thunbergia can be readily distinguished from other similar species growing in South Africa, but is possibly often confused with other species growing in Zimbabwe and further north.
","Gardenia thunbergia occurs in a strip up the eastern coast of South Africa from near Grahamstown in Eastern Cape to Kosi Bay in the north of KwaZulu-Natal. It occurs primarily in evergreen forest and forest margin, occasionally in woodland and bushveld.

It may be distinguished from G. resiniflua, the gummy gardenia, by its much larger fruits, and from G. volkensii, the Transvaal or savannah gardenia, by the fact that its fruits are not ribbed. G. cornuta, the Natal gardenia, which has un-ribbed fruits of similar size and shape can be distinguished by the fact that its fruits are orange not grey. G. ternifolia (= G. jovis-tonantis) the large-leaved Transvaal gardenia, has short hairs on both leaf surfaces, which are rough to the touch, whereas G. thunbergia leaves are smooth and hairless. Another distinguishing feature is that G. thunbergia flowers do not age yellow as many of the other species do. Hyperacanthus amoenus (= Gardenia amoena) the spiny gardenia, has paired spines at right angles to the next pair, and pink tinged white flowers. Gardenias are also quite similar to rothmannias, but an easy way to distinguish them is by their flowers: gardenia flowers are tubular with many petals, whereas rothmannia flowers are funnel shaped with only five petals.

Moths are attracted to the flowers and are probably the pollinators. The fruits do not burst or split open, or drop, and can remain on the bush for years. They are adapted to being eaten by elephants, large antelope and buffalo, and the seed coats are tough enough to pass through their digestive systems unscathed. Unless man intervenes, the seeds will not be released from the fruits and dispersed unless these animals eat them. Harvesting Gardenia thunbergia seed is hard work. The secateurs we use to cut off the fruits are blunted by the end of the process, not to mention our hands that are also worn out. We have to use hammers, or any heavy, blunt instrument we can find to break the fruits open, and nails and heavy duty spoons to scoop the seeds out. It is heavy, laborious, unpopular work!
",,"Gardenia thunbergia is easy to grow, although it is slow-growing. It does best in sun or semi-shade, in slightly acid, light, well-drained soil with plenty of organic matter added and regular deep watering. Mulch thickly and regularly. Although Gardenia thunbergia is relatively slow growing and generally needs little pruning, it may need to be pruned to keep it shapely, or in scale with its container. Pruning should be done after flowering or just before the new growth appears.

Although it is moderately drought tolerant, drought stress can cause buds to fall before opening. Gardenia thunbergia is half hardy and should tolerate a winter minimum of -1°C (25-30°F) although young plants will require protection from frost. If you notice yellowing of the leaves, this is usually due to a trace element deficiency and can be corrected by feeding with a fertilizer that includes trace elements.

It looks good as a specimen plant on a lawn, or as part of an informal hedge or shrubbery, or planted beside a pond or a stream. It also makes a good pot plant in a large container, its pale grey bark and angular shape making it an interesting form plant, while the flowers perfume the air. It is also suitable for bonsai.
It is easily propagated from seed, cuttings or truncheon cuttings. Seed can be sown in spring to early summer, even in late summer if your winters are mild. Germination should take 4-6 weeks. Cuttings can be taken at any time of the year, but best results are obtained in summer. Rooting of cuttings is best under mist, using a 100-120 mm piece of young (approx. 2 month old) growth with 2 or 3 sets of leaves. There is no need to remove the leaves as it appears to slow the rooting process down. Truncheon cuttings are best taken in early spring, and placed in well-drained, sandy soil in a cool, shady spot and kept damp but not wet.
",,,"Roots are widely used in Africa to treat skin diseases, and skin lesions caused by leprosy. The roots are also used as an emetic against fever. The rootbark is used as an emetic for biliousness, and to treat gall bladder problems. The roots and leaves are used in various parts of Africa to treat syphilis, and the latex is used as a purgative.

The wood is heavy, dense and extraordinarily hard, a pleasing yellowish colour, and it presents a high lustre when polished. It also has the unusual ability to bend without breaking, but its use is limited because it is difficult to find large pieces. It is used for making buttons, tools, clubs, yokes, axles and implement handles. The fruits would make novel Xmas baubles.

Bauhinia natalensis,Bauhinia natalensis,,"This lovely ornamental, rounded shrub is relatively fast growing and within a few years reaches its mature size of 2.5 x 3 metres.

The distinctively butterfly-like leaves consist of two rounded, almost completely divided, nearly semi-circular lobes and in Bauhinia natalensis they are delightful miniatures, being much smaller than any of the other South African species.

White, lightly fragrant, delicate, azalea-like flowers are borne in profusion — this plant can be almost completely covered with flowers for a long period throughout summer from November to April. The slightly crinkly oval petals are made all the more attractive by one of the petals having a red or deep pink centre stripe. The next two petals each has a lighter, thinner stripe and the other two are plain white.
The small fruit pods, 70 x 100 mm, are golden brown with pointed tips, borne from January to June; they split open when ripe, scattering the brown seeds.
","The genus Bauhinia was established by Linnaeus in 1753 and honours the brothers Johan and Caspar Bauhin, both botanists and herbalists from the 16th century. They were identical twin brothers, so the name is quite apt as the characteristic paired leaves when folded together, are identical. The species name natalensis refers to the area where this species most commonly occurs.

The Afrikaans common name beesklou (cattle foot) is applied to most of the bauhinias and refers to the resemblance of the leaf to the footprint of cloven-hoofed animals.

Many of the almost 300 species of Bauhinia (orchid trees or camelsfoot) are popular garden subjects because of their decorative foliage and ornamental flowers and are widely grown in subtropical or tropical regions of the world. Some are used for their timber. Common to all members of this family are the two-lobed leaves, pod fruits and showy flowers. The common names of the genus refer respectively to the shape of the flower and the shape of the leaves which resemble a camel's foot when laid flat.

Most bauhinias are woody shrubs, some climbing with tendrils or scrambling, and some are small trees. The most commonly cultivated is the exotic Bauhinia variegata, the orchid tree, originally from India and China. 
","Found in valley bushveld and scrub. Distribution is restricted to the Eastern Cape and the southern KwaZulu-Natal coastal strip.

There are seven bauhinias that are indigenous to southern Africa , and all show horticultural promise. The most well known and widely cultivated is the pride-of-De Kaap, B. galpinii , bearing masses of bright orange-red flowers in summer. There is also the yellow bauhinia or bosbeesklou, B. tomentosa , a large shrub or small tree with bell-shaped yellow flowers; the Kalahari white bauhinia or koffiebeesklou, B. petersiana, a scrambling shrub or small tree with very crinkled white flowers. This species is divided into two subspecies, B. petersiana subsp. macrantha, which has broader petals, a smaller habit and occurs in the northwestern parts of South Africa, Namibia, Zimbabwe and Angola, and B. petersiana subsp. petersiana, which is usually a small tree and occurs in northeastern Zimbabwe, Mozambique and northwards; the Kei white bauhinia, B. bowkeri, a scrambling shrub with bunches of white flowers, is a rare endemic in the Transkei and Eastern Cape; and the pink bauhinia or sandbeesklou B. urbaniana, a shrub or bushy tree with rose-pink flowers from northeastern Namibia.

An interesting feature of this plant is that the leaves are adapted to close in response to reduced light. Caterpillars of the Common Emperor and the Banded Achaea moths feed on the leaves and flowers. Whitebellied sunbirds are regular visitors to the flowers.

The great combination of foliage, flowers and the growth habit of Bauhinia natalensis offers makes it a plant with exceptional horticultural potential for any garden.
",,"Bauhinia natalensis will grow in full sun or in semi-shade. Once established it needs a moderate amount of water throughout the year and will tolerate almost any given rainfall. It is fairly sensitive to frost and will lose all its leaves if stressed, re-sprouting when conditions improve.

It is tolerant of a wide range of soils but seems to do best if planted in fertile, well-composted soil. If the soil is not that rich then feed regularly with a general fertilizer or apply a bi-annual dressing of compost and mulch before summer.

It is relatively fast growing and naturally neat so should require no pruning, although a light trim to gently shape it may occasionally be done.

Bauhinia natalensis can be grown beautifully as a solitary specimen, but has a lovely massed effect when grown in small groups of three or five. All the species of Bauhinia flower prolifically for long periods of time and the individual flowers are quite long-lived. Its multi-stemmed habit provides a suitable screen or it suits an informal shrub border. It has a very mild root system and can be used for growing against fences and walls.

Bauhinia natalensis is well suited to bonsai and, because of its size and habit, is perfect for the smaller garden or even for use in containers.

The seeds germinate easily and are best sown in spring. Germination should occur within two weeks; soaking the seeds in warm water overnight will speed up the germination process. Sow 1-2 mm deep in sandy, well-drained potting soil. To prevent pre- and post-emergence damping off, the seed should be treated with a fungicide prior to sowing, or watered with a fungicide immediately after sowing. After germination the seedlings should be potted up into individual bags/pots as soon as the first pair of true leaves appears. It may also seed itself freely in the garden, where the seedlings may also be dug up and transplanted into individual bags/pots as soon as the first pair of true leaves appears.

Tagetes minuta,Tagetes minuta,"Although Tagetes Oil is not a popular fragrance oil, it is used in some perfumes","An erect, woody, annual, herbaceous weed, up to 2 m tall. Stems are unbranched or branching repeatedly in the upper parts, grooved or ridged. Stems are green at first, but changes to brownish or yellowish after flowering. The leaves are pinnately dissected into 4 to 6 pairs of pinnae.

Plants produce clusters of up to 80 cylindrical flower heads in a panicle-like inflorescence. The heads are 10–15 mm long, enclosed by 4 or 5, fused involucral bracts. Each head generally contains about 3 ray florets with short, broad, lemon-coloured lamina and 3 disc florets.

Fruits are narrow, cylindrical and usually dark brown.

","The common name of Tagetes minuta in English, khaki-weed, is derived from its supposed introduction by English khaki-clad soldiers during the Anglo Boer War (1899–1902). The weed was introduced with the imported fodder for the British Army’s horses. The earliest record in South Africa appears to be in 1905 at Vlakfontein. In 1909, it was recorded at Grahamstown as a troublesome weed. The first record for KwaZulu-Natal was noticed in Newcastle in 1910. By 1920 it was widespread in South Africa.
","It flowers and fruits in summer.

Tagetes minuta as naturalized exotic weed in South Africa, and therefore has not been evaluated for the Red List of South African plants.

Tagetes minuta is an invasive weed that prefers growing in disturbed areas, such as old lands on farms, abandoned gardens, roadsides and waste places. It grows on dry or moist soil. It is originally from South and North America, but is now widespread everywhere in South Africa and neighboring areas.

After the Anglo Boer war in South Africa, Australian troops took plants home to their native land, where it now also grows profusely.

Tagetes minuta is a pioneer plant and its roots assist in stabilizing disturbed soils. The flowers are mostly pollinated by insects and honeybees. Seeds are dispersed through different mechanisms, such as harvesting with crops and fodder, blown away by wind, carried away by small animals, birds or insects, or washed away by rain water.

Tagetes minuta is adapted to high temperatures and can tolerate low rainfall, but is not frost-hardy.
Although khaki bush can be harvested from the veld and provides an income to collectors, it is also grown commercially in South Africa, France and North America for its essential oil. The oil has a wild-citrus-like smell and has a yellowish to reddish amber colour.

Highland Essential Oils on the farm Vlakbult (near Clocolan) cultivate around 500 ha of Tagetes (about half of their production need) annually, for an output of about 1 ton of oil.

Leaves, stalks and flowers are picked when plants are in seed, mechanically chopped and the oil is then steam-distilled. Initially the oil has a wild unpleasant smell, but after 12 months of maturity, it achieves a pleasant sweet-fruity (mango-like) smell and attains a stable composition. During maturation, the oil thickens and the colour darkens. The aroma of the oil develops further in the following 5 years, after which the oil quality deteriorates.

",,"Several other species of Tagetes, commonly known as marigolds with their rich and vibrant orange, yellow and brownish colours, are very popular as garden plants and in many cultures it plays an important role in traditional ceremonies. In Mexico, it is regarded as a flower of the dead during the 1st November celebrations of the Day of the Dead, where they use it to honor the lives of the family and friends who have passed away. It is believed that its strong odour attracts dead souls towards the flowers, therefore burial sites are adorned with marigolds. It was used by the Aztecs in many religious ceremonies and also as a medicine. In India, it is widely cultivated to make garlands, for decorative purpose in marriages and festivals.

Tagetes minuta grows on light (sandy), medium (loamy) or heavy (clay) soils, which are well drained, acidic, neutral or alkaline. It prefers sunny positions. Tagetes minuta can be propagated by seeds after the danger of frost is well passed. To encourage the seed germination, soil temperature should be 18.3°C or warmer.

Select a location in your garden that receives full sun and loosen the soil. Sow the seeds in early spring directly into the beds. Seeds should be sown approximately 1 cm deep and covered lightly with the garden soil. Water the area thoroughly and then water on a regular basis throughout the growing season. Plants will start to germinate within 2 weeks and will then reach maturity within 120 days of planting. Collect the seeds from drying plants to use them again or allow the plant to self-seed.
",,,"It can be blended with massage oil or used in the bath where it can assist with wounds, cuts, coughs, chest infections, parasitic and fungal infestations.

The oil is very effectively used for wounds and a wide variety of infections.

The boiled leaves of the Tagetes minuta are used to treat infections in the respiratory system or stomach problems, by drinking the boiled mixture. In a 5% dilution, Tagetes Oil has been used to kill maggots in open wounds. When used in a cream or lotion, it can have a beneficial effect on fungal and microbial infections and especially helpful when treating weeping wounds or athletes foot.

In burners, vaporizers or steamers, the vapour from the leaves can treat headaches, coughs, bronchitis, chest infections or be an insect repellent for a wide variety of insects. The vapour also acts as an antiseptic in a room.

The leaves and flowers are a good insect repellent and are often seen hanging in dwellings to deter swarms of flies and mosquitoes. The oil is also used as a repellent to the bowfly and is useful as a bowfly dressing.
","Caution should be taken when using Tagetes Oil. It is very powerful and should be used sparingly on the skin (less than 0.5% dilution), not used on a sensitive skin, and avoided during pregnancy. It is photo toxic and may cause photosensitivity.",,,,
Halleria elliptica,Halleria elliptica,,"A long-lived, erect shrub or small tree, growing 1–2 m tall. Leaves are paired, opposite and stalked, elliptically shaped, 12–36 mm long and 6–22 mm wide, bright green, thin leathery, toothed in the upper two-thirds of the leaf margin and tapering to a point.

Halleria elliptica is assessed as Least Concern (LC) according to the Red List of South African plants.
","Until recently, Hallleria was included in the Scrophulariaceae, a large family, consisting mainly of herbs and shrubs and well known for its exotic members, such as the snapdragon and foxglove. Recent molecular studies have shown that it belongs in the Stilbaceae, a smaller, mainly African family containing Stilbe and Retzia, and now also Ansastrabe, Bowkeria, Nuxia and Halleria.

The genus Halleria is named after Albrecht von Haller (1708-77), Swiss professor of botany at Gottingen. The species name elliptica refers to the elliptical shape of the leaves which are longer than wide and broadest in the middle.

The common names tree-fuchsia and wild-fuchsia come from the plant’s fuchsia-like flowers and the Afrikaans common name, kinderbessie, meaning 'children's berry', is related to how much children enjoy the taste of the fruits.
","The genus Halleria is widespread, occurring across Yemen, Madagascar, Africa; Ethiopia to the Cape Peninsula; also in Angola. Halleria elliptica occurs only in South Africa where it is found in the Western Cape. It occurs in mixed bush or on lower slopes, often near streams, from Algeria in the Cedarberg Mountains to Swellendam, within the Fynbos Biome. It is often found in montane to riverine forest, scrub and bush. There are only three species in southern Africa, the other two species being Halleria lucida and H. ovata.

Pendulous, tubular, orange flowers, 10–17 mm long, occur in autumn, winter and spring (April to October), in pairs in the leaf axils, sometimes solitary or in clusters and occasionally on older, woodier, leafless branches or on the main stem. The cup-shaped calyx has 3–5 lobes and is very much shorter than the corolla, which is 4- or 5-lobed, with the upper lip 2-lobed and the lower lip shortly 3-lobed. The corolla tube is inflated to form a funnel-shape, which is curved or straight. From mid-winter to late summer (June to February) the plant bears ovoid fruits, which are green berries, ripening to a juicy black. The berries are filled with tiny, narrowly winged seeds that appear as very small, black flakes submerged in the jelly-like flesh of the fruit.

Rich in nectar, it attracts insects, particularly bees and butterflies. It is also alluring to a wide variety of nectar-loving and fruit- and insect-eating birds, who adore the volume of nectar it produces and the delicious fruit. Children also like the sweet fruits. Cattle, goats and game browse on the leaves.

The fleshy fruits are edible and taste sweet, although they tend to dry the mouth out. They are ripe and juicy when black in colour.
",,"Halleria elliptica is valuable in horticultural due to its versatility, pretty fuchsia-like flowers and attractiveness to both nectar- and fruit-eating birds, as well as many insects.

An excellent medium-sized shrub or small tree, that fits well into both large gardens planted in groups and smaller gardens used singularly. Halleria elliptica is best suited to semi-shaded and shaded areas, in any type of soil. As a Western Cape endemic, it has moderate to low water requirements and is well adapted to summer drought and is winter rainfall-waterwise. However, it does flourish in good soil with regular watering, growing faster and lusher. Hardy, adaptable and very versatile, they can be used as specimen plants or in mixed plantings. As part of a shrubbery, it will provide colourful vibrancy when in flower. It tolerates some morning or afternoon sun, and can be used in full or dappled shade, even doing well planted under trees.
Halleria elliptica may need tidying up to remove dead and twiggy growth, and it can be pruned to shape and clipped into a hedge, it makes a wonderful screening plant. The plant has few pest or disease problems. Although in nature they often grow in colonies, spreading by means of an underground rootstock, they have a non-aggressive root system, and lend themselves to propagation by layering.

Halleria elliptica is easily propagated from cuttings or seed. Sow seed in autumn or spring in a well-drained soil mix and cover lightly with the sowing medium. To prevent pre- and post-emergence damping off, the seed should be treated with a fungicide prior to sowing, or watered with a fungicide immediately after sowing. The flesh of the fruit contains germination inhibitors, so be sure to remove this outer covering first. The seed usually germinates within 3 to 6 weeks. Transplant the seedlings into individual bags/pots as soon as they are strong, after the first pair of true leaves has emerged. Feed generously with a liquid fertilizer and water moderately.

Take semi-hardwood stem cuttings in autumn or spring. Place in a well-aerated and supportive rooting medium and keep damp, but not wet, in a warm, well-lit and well-ventilated area, with no direct sunlight. The application of a rooting hormone is recommended, to increase success of rooting. Water consistently and rooting can be achieved within 6 to 8 weeks, with no bottom heat. After roots are established, pot on. Regular fertilizing will encourage the growth of the plantlets. Keep in the shade, semi-protected, until ready for planting.
",,,"Fruits can be eaten fresh or stored for a while, consumed raw, or made into a jelly/jam.

A relative of Halleria ellpitica is H. lucida, which has medicinal, traditional, spiritual and construction uses, particularly for the Zulus. Halleria elliptica grows in the Western Cape and being so much smaller and more shrub-like, it was not utilized as much in these traditional ways.

Thunbergia alata,Thunbergia alata,,"Thunbergia alata is a soft, perennial climber about 1-5 x 1 m with many twining stems. The leaves are heart- or arrow-shaped, softly hairy and sometimes toothed. Many flowers are borne singly in leaf axils with a small calyx enclosed in 2 large, ridged bracts. The corolla is obliquely trumpet-shaped and is usually bright orange in wild plants. The inside of the tube is a striking dark maroon or purplish black. Nurseries also have variants with white, cream- or peach-coloured, yellow to deep orange or nearly red flowers. The fruit is like a bird's head with a spherical base and a long 'beak'. This plant flowers all summer but can continue all year in warmer areas.

Thunbergia alata is not a threatened plant at present.

Streptocarpus gardenii,Streptocarpus gardenii,,"herbaceous perennial that grows wider than it is high — 300 x 70 mm, with a shallow root system. Green small strap-like leaves are softly hairy, arranged in a rosette formation, margins scalloped, reddish purple beneath. The inflorescence stalks arise from near the bottom of the midrib of each leaf and flowers of all Streptocarpus have a tiny five-lobed calyx backing a tubular corolla that flares out into a five-lobed mouth. This Streptocarpus flower is usually solitary, sometimes paired, with a narrow greenish-white floral tube and a pale violet lower corolla lip that is streaked with striking deep violet lines, in a broken or unbroken pattern, sometimes even absent.","The name Streptocarpus is derived from the Greek words streptos meaning twisted and carpus meaning fruit, which is a perfect description of the plant's spirally twisted seed pods. The specific name was given in honour of Captain R.J. Garden who, in 1853, was attached to the 45th regiment. In that year he was commissioned by the government to explore the country between the Umzimkulu and Giant Castle mountains, and he did a certain amount of collecting.

Cape primroses made their mark in England when they first blossomed at Kew Botanical Gardens in England in 1826, compliments of the collector James Bowie, who took the first plants of Streptocarpus rexii there. As more species were introduced into cultivation in later years, different hybrid Streptocarpus were produced.

Streptocarpus belongs to the same family, Gesneriaceae, as the well-known African violets (Saintpaulia) and gloxinias (Sinningia) that are grown as pot plants all over the world. The Gesneriaceae — named in 1969 after a Swiss scholar, Konrad Gesner, thirty years after his death — is a large family of mostly tropical and subtropical herbs, with ± 139 genera, and ± 2900 species worldwide. Of the 8 genera occurring in Africa, the genus Streptocarpus, which has ± 51 species, is native to southern Africa.","The shallow root system allows many of the members of the Gesneriaceae to grow successfully as epiphytes, growing on the trunks of trees; or lithophytes, growing in thin layers of moss or humus on rocks; or terrestrially, in the ground soil or in leaf litter on the forest floor. This species is found growing in all three of these situations. The plant can cross-pollinate easily with other species but in many instances are self-pollinated. All the seed pods of this genus have a spiral construction and when the pod dries out the spiral relaxes like a spring, releasing the very small seed to be scattered by the wind.",,"Streptocarpus have a lot horticultural potential as indoor and outdoor plants although the trend of most gardeners is to ignore the species and concentrate on the beautiful modern hybrids with their huge trumpet-shaped flowers, often double, in shades of pink, red, blue, lilac, purple, yellow and white. New hybrids are constantly being introduced to the huge and growing pot plant market.

Streptocarpus gardenii does best as a pot plant rather than planted out in the garden. Ensure a warm spot with good light but no direct sunlight. The plant in general is very sensitive to light and is burned easily by the sun, but flowers poorly in deep shade. Light shade with good ventilation is best for growing healthy plants with plenty of flowers.

Streptocarpus gardenii is a plant that is seldom seen in gardens as it is uncommon in the trade and because it can be difficult to grow in home garden conditions.

Watering Streptocarpus should be done with care. It is very important that the plants should not be over-watered, to avoid rotting and fungal problems. Allow them to get quite dry between watering — they can be allowed to wilt slightly as they have the ability to recover very well from this, but be aware that severe wilting can also be a sign of root rot caused by over-watering, so check the medium to see that this is not the case.

During the warm summers when they are actively growing, they need plenty of water. Most of the Streptocarpus species have a 'rest period' during winter and this slight dormancy will cause them to need very little water during this stage.

Regularly remove all dead, unhealthy, dying leaves and flowers as these encourage fungal growth, and to keep the plants looking attractive. The tips of the leaves often die off as they get older and when stressed by drought or low temperature or when overwintering. This survival tactic does not harm the plants, as although the dead ends may look unattractive, each of the leaves simply forms an abscission layer and continues with new growth from the base. Regular feeding during the growing season with liquid foliar feed is recommended.

Repotting of plants should commence once the roots appear at the bottom of the pot. Remember that with Streptocarpus it is better to under-pot than to over-pot as most of them have shallow root systems and in their natural habitats most often grow in very little soil, if any at all.

Removing spent flowerheads will encourage a longer flowering period as it encourages new flower development.

All propagation is best done in spring which is the start of the growing season. Streptocarpus gardenii can easily be grown from seed. When sowing the seeds, mix a pinch of the dust-like seeds with a small amount of sand to assist with spreading the seeds evenly. Use a well-drained medium that is not too coarse. Cover with a very thin layer of sand, keep out of direct sun but in warmth. Water regularly with a fine spray. Germination usually takes 3-4 weeks, and do not allow the seedlings to dry out. Better germination results are often obtained if the seed tray is covered with a glass sheet or enclosed in a clear plastic packet. Plant the seedlings into small pots only once they are quite big and strong. Transplant again into bigger pots when the roots have filled the small pots.

To get new plants identical to the parents, it is best to propagate from cuttings. Streptocarpus can be propagated from a single leaf and the best results are from leaf cuttings taken in spring and early summer. A variety of mediums can be used as long as they are well drained. Sand, bark, palm fibre and polystyrene or vermiculite in different ratios are all suitable. At Kirstenbosch we use 40 % bark, 40 % polystyrene and 20 % riversand. Water the medium well and treat with a suitable fungicide before using. Select healthy youngish leaves from the centre of the plant and cut off using a sharp knife or blade. Remember that the most active region of the leaf is near the base where the growing region (meristem) is present and so this area will yield the best rooting results. If it is a small leaf, then insert the cut end of the leaf as is into a rooting hormone and then into the medium, larger leaves can be cut into 3 cm strips with each bottom cut end being dipped into rooting hormone.

Always take note of which way the leaf cutting should be orientated before dipping into a rooting hormone and wedge firmly into the medium but not too deep as this will encourage rot. Alternatively, cut along either side of the midrib and treat in the same manner. Plantlets will form along the base of the cut end, in one to three months depending on the species.

When the plantlets are well established, the `old' leaf can be teased out from the medium and the little plantlets gently separated off and then potted up, usually between 6-12 months.

Plants that have grown quite large can also just be divided as a method of increasing them; do this in early spring and repot to grow on. Mature plants can lose their vigour after 3 to 5 years and propagation as described above can be used to replace them with younger plants.

Mealy bug, aphids and caterpillars are the most troublesome pests of Streptocarpus. Caterpillars can either be hand collected or sprayed with a suitable poison; aphids can be sprayed or removed carefully by running a thumb and forefinger along the flower stem, where they usually occur; if mealy bug is found on any part of the plant, quickly remove the affected parts and treat with a suitable pesticide. Kirstenbosch has had great success in managing infestations by using biological control with the natural predators of mealy bug.

Fungal infections are also a cause for concern; if fungus is found on any part of the plant, remove the affected parts and treat with a suitable fungicide

Streptocarpus are usually prone to pests and diseases only when they are not treated or grown correctly — any plant that is stressed is more likely to come under attack. So, to reduce the occurrence of problems, avoid the following: overwatering, underfeeding, root-bound plants, lack of good air movement/circulation.",,,Some species of Streptocarpus are used in Zulu medicine where leaf infusions are drunk to ease birthing pains.,,,,,
Encephalartos middelburgensis,Encephalartos middelburgensis,,"Encephalartos middelburgensis is a large cycad, with an aerially unbranched, erect stem which tends to recline when long, growing in clumps of up to twelve stems and producing suckers freely from the base; the stem grows up to 7m tall with a diameter of 250-400 mm; the stem apex is characterised by inconspicuous, long and slender cataphylls (scale leaves).
","This species was published in 1989 by P.J. (Hannes) Robbertse, Pieter J. Vorster and Suzelle van der Westhuizen, after John J. Lavranos and Douglas L. Goode had described it during the previous year as Encephalartos eugene-maraisii subsp. middelburgensis. The epithet refers to Middelburg District in which the species mainly occurs.","
The leaves are stiff, attain a length of 1.0-1.5 m, bluish-green, straight, with the apex tending to curve very slightly upwards, with persistent powdery bloom and with the same colour on both upper and lower side. Young leaves are often silvery due to a dense covering of powdery bloom. Leaflets tend to shield one another downwards but only at the leaf apex; median leaflets are leathery and without nodules, 180-190 mm long and 14-19 mm broad. The margin of the lower leaflets tends to curve upwards while that of the upper ones tends to curve downwards; the basal leaflets decrease in size, usually to one or two spines. The petiole (leaf stalk) is triangular and 100-200 mm long.

Male and female plants bear 4-8 reddish brown cones per season per stem. Male cones attain a length of up to 450-700 mm and a diameter of 85-130 mm, having a stalk up to 50-170 mm long. Female cones attain a length of up to 350-450 mm and a diameter of 170-200 mm, with a stalk up to 150 mm long which is usually obscured largely by the cataphylls of the stem. Cones of Encephalartos middelburgensis do not disintegrate spontaneously as those of the other species do, but dry out during September-October to yield 170-260 detached seeds. Seeds are yellow to light brown, with a length of 38-40 mm and a diameter of 22-24 mm. According to Raimondo et al. (2009), E. middelburgensis is critically endangered (CR), as the best available evidence indicates that it meets all five IUCN criteria for critically endangered, and is therefore facing an extremely high risk of extinction in the wild.

The Middelburg cycad occurs in Mpumalanga, in the upper catchment area of the Olifants River between Middelburg and Loskop Dam. It grows in open grassy, rocky areas on steep slopes on slightly acidic soils at between 1000-1400 m altitude above sea level. The annual rainfall in its distribution area is 600 mm and occurs predominantly in summer. The climate in the area is hot in summer and cold in winter. E. middelburgensis grows well in full sunlight and is frost-hardy.",,"Encephalartos midddelburgensis is easily propagated from seeds and suckers (the young plants that grow around the main stem). Seedlings at the one-leaf stage are susceptible to the fungal disease ""damping off"" which kills the seedling's single leaf at ground level.

The seeds should be collected, cleaned and stored in a brown paper bag at 10-15 ºC for six months or more, to allow the embryo to fully develop. The seeds are cleaned to ensure that all the flesh is removed since it may contain germination inhibitors and can also promote the growth of fungi. The flesh is scraped away with a knife. Protective gloves should be worn during the cleaning operation to prevent contact with the slow-acting poisons present in the flesh. If the flesh is hard and dry, it helps to soak the seeds in water for a day or two before cleaning. Even if the seeds have been cleaned, it is a good idea to soak them for a few days, preferably with daily changes of water, before planting them. When the seeds are placed in water, the viable ones will sink and the non-viable ones will float.

To germinate the seeds, place the cleaned seeds on their sides half buried on washed sand or potting mix, and keep at about 28 ºC. It is necessary to keep the medium moist, but not too wet, for as long as it takes for germination to take place. As soon as the radicals of the sprouted kernels are 10-20 mm long, they can be planted singly in plastic bags containing potting soil or some other suitable medium. Alternatively, one can wait until the seedlings develop one or two leaves before transplanting them individually into bags.

Because cycad seedlings form long tap roots, it is advisable to use tall narrow perforated black plastic bags about 24 x12 cm in size for their initial establishment. Place the seedlings under shade for the first few years of growth and development. Initially the seedlings must be watered daily with a fine spray. After about a month, as their roots elongate, the frequency of watering should be decreased to once a week. The seedlings can be transplanted into the garden when they are 3-5 years old.

When preparing to propagate from suckers, a hole should be dug around the stem of the mother plant to expose the base and roots of the suckers. One must use a clean sharp knife or sharp spade to remove the sucker from the mother plant. The wound should then be treated with flowers of sulphur or a fungicide such as Benlate or Kaptan and dried for about a week before planting the sucker into a sterile medium.

Cycads are ideal for a low maintenance garden, as they require a minimum of water and are undemanding in their soil and environmental needs.

Pests troublesome to cycads are scale insects, beetles and chewing insects. Scale insects cause great damage to cycad leaves by sucking the sap from them. Most scale insects can be controlled with regular and frequent applications of horticultural soluble oil such as white oil. Beetles seriously damage cycad plants by attacking the emerging young leaves. Control can be kept by application of contact or systemic insecticides, or one of the bacterial preparations available.",Everyone who is in possession of cycads must have a permit. Please contact your provincial nature conservation authority for details,,"The fleshy outer covering layer of the seeds is desirable food for a range of animals such as monkeys, birds, rodents and bats. Therefore, with any luck, the seeds are discarded some distance away from the parent plant in a hospitable environment in which they are likely to germinate.

Cycads can be used as attractive decorative or focal point plants in gardens, and can also be very effective as grouped plantings with some succulents.",,,,,
Erica sparsa,Erica sparsa var. sparsa,,"an erect shrub about 1 m tall. It has many upward-pointing (ascending) branches that are covered in short, ash-grey hairs. Leaves are small and needle-like (linear) and the edges are rolled back until they almost meet under the leaf (sulcate), although this is difficult to see with the naked eye, because they are so small.
It produces masses of small, pale rosy pink to white flowers from late summer to early spring (February to August). They are densely crowded on short branchlets almost completely obscuring the leaves. The calyx looks similar to the corolla and the base of the sepals are fused. The corolla is broadly cup shaped, about 1 mm long, with an open mouth. The style protrudes well beyond the mouth of the corolla and the stigma is cone- to cup-shaped. The anthers are dark purple and do not protrude from the flower, although they can be seen at the mouth.Erica sparsa occurs on the coastal flats and lower slopes from Mossel Bay in the Western Cape to the Albany District in the Eastern Cape and is common in the George and Knysna areas where it forms dense colonies.","The genus Erica gets its name from ereiko, meaning ‘to break’, either because of the ability of the plant to break up bladder stones or more probably because the stems are brittle and break easily. The species name sparsa is from Latin, and means ‘scattered’ or ‘spotted’, but what characteristic of the species it is referring to, is not known.","There are two varieties recognized: Erica sparsa Lodd. var. sparsa and E. sparsa var. glanduloso-pedicellata Dulfer.

The flower has five rounded white petals, the glistening white resembling porcelain, with a suffusion of red along the veins. The underside of the petal is flushed pink and the sepals are leaf-like, glabrous or hairy and rolled. The flowering buds are red before they open and flowers decorate the shrub from mid-winter to spring (July to October).","The genus name of Adenandra is derived from the Greek aden meaning, a gland; ander, a man and uniflora derived from the Latin, meaning one flower. ","New stems are lightly hairy. Each anther is tipped with a tiny, curiously sticky gland. Staminodes are, erect or slightly incurved, 2.5-4.4 mm long, and like the stamens are hairy. The stamens are peculiar, each carrying a conspicuous red terminal knob or gland. Small, oblong, light green leaves are densely to rather sparsely arranged on branches. The leaves are smooth above with revolute margins (rolling back), are 0.5-1 mm long, sometimes with a recurved apex, and are aromatic, with 10-60 inconspicuous glandular dots (oil glands). The mature seed capsule is enclosed by a large, leaf-like, green calyx segment.Adenandra uniflora occurs on the sandstone slopes of the southwestern Cape mountains from the Cape Peninsula to the Kleinrivier Mountains. Adenandra uniflora can be distinguished from A. villosa by its relatively soft leaves with revolute margins, solitary flowers, large, leaf-like calyx segments and smaller anthers. A. villosa bears clusters of white flowers at the tips of branches with a maroon streak in the centre of each petal. Leaves are minute and flat, sepals flat.

Each seed case splits down the inner side and through differential drying and contracting of the inner layer, forcibly ejects its single seed. This phenomenon is known as ballistic dispersal.",,"Adenandra uniflora grows best when planted in full sun and needs adequate water during the hot summer months. It requires a soil that is well drained, composted and enriched with a well-balanced fertilizer (3:2:1). It is slow growing and needs space in the garden bed to allow it to develop to its full potential without being squashed by other faster growing plants.Buchu naturally occurs in mixed fynbos and ideally should be used in this way in a garden. Plant the china flower with companion plants such as restios, pelargoniums, Helichrysum, Phylica, Euryops, Felicia and Leonotis. It can be grown as a border plant, planted in masses or planted in a pot where its immaculate flowers can be admired at close range.
Like other fynbos plants, planting buchus in your garden is best done after the first good winter rains, (May to July at the Cape). Buchus respond to fairly dense plantings, which help to retain soil moisture. An annual mulching of well-rotted compost is advised, to reduce weeds and keep the soil temperature low.
Buchus can be grown from seed or cuttings. Fresh buchu seed is sown in autumn. The seed are sown into a tray containing a well-drained medium of equal portions of sand, loam and compost. Use some of the medium to cover the seed and water. Place in a covered area with good light and air circulation. Keep medium damp. Germination occurs in 1 to 2 months.Young seedlings are pricked out into 0.5 litre bags containing a fynbos medium, when four true leaves have developed. Pinch out the growing tips of the seedlings to encourage bushy growth. Flowers are produced after two years.Cuttings have the advantage of producing a larger flowering plant quicker than seedlings. Tip cuttings, 50-70 mm, are taken from the current year's growth. Prepare cuttings by making a clean cut below the node and remove a third of the foliage. Dip the base of the cutting in a rooting hormone. Firmly place the cuttings in a medium of 50% bark and 50 % polystyrene. Ideally these cuttings should now be placed in a well-aerated propagation unit with a bottom heat of 24° C. Rooting occurs in 9 to 11 weeks. Carefully pot the rooted cuttings using a well-drained, humus-rich fynbos-potting medium (2 parts leaf mould, 1 part coarse sand). Plants will be ready for planting in 7 to 8 months. Feed regularly with a well-balanced nutrient. Yellow leaves can be treated with an application of iron chelate.",,,Dried leaves are used for potpourri.,,,,,
Syncolostemon macranthus,Syncolostemon macranthus, aromatic,"Like most species of Lamiaceae, Syncolostemon macranthus is an aromatic, straggling, soft shrub that grows up to 1.0–2.5 m high. The stems have stiff, short and prickly hairs. The leaves are oppositely arranged, ovate to lanceolate, 20–45 × 12–20 mm, with finely toothed margins; base obtuse to cuneate and apex acute to obtuse; petiole 2–8 mm long.

Inflorescence is simple or usually branched, 80–180 mm long, with clusters of long, tubular flowers, 4–18 mm apart; bracts 3–5 × 3–4 mm. Calyx is cylindrical, 9–10 mm long. Flowers are pink to pale mauve or purple, 25–30 mm long, gradually widening at the mouth to 5–6 mm, lower lip longer, up to 3–5 mm, usually bent downwards at maturity, upper lip short. Stamens well exserted and often coiled; 2 upper filaments arising from ± half way up the corolla tube. Style well exserted. Flowering time is in summer (from October to April) with a peak in late summer (March). Fruit is an oblong, semi-terete nutlet. Syncolostemon macranthus has a restricted distribution, occurring in KwaZulu-Natal and the eastern Free State, in the Drakensberg Mountains between Cathedral Peak and Van Reenen’s Pass. It inhabits mountain slopes, margins of stream banks, moist gullies, grassy scree slopes, fairly damp grass slopes and forest margins. It is near endemic of the floristic region known as the Drakensberg Alpine Centre. Grows well in summer rainfall areas, but can also adapt very well in cold, wet winter and hot, dry summer, but requires sufficient water. It cannot tolerate frost, but does slowly bounce back after frost.

","In 1898, a German botanist Gürke, in the Berlin Botanical Museum, described Orthosiphon macranthus. The genus was later transferred to Syncolostemon by Ashby, in 1935. The name Syncolostemon refers to the structure of the stamens, syn- meaning ‘united’, kolos, ‘stunted’, and stemon ‘pillar’, referring to the lower pairs of the filament which are attached to the flower tube. The species name macranthus means ‘long-flowered’ from the Greek, makros meaning ‘long’, ‘tall’, ‘high’, ‘deep’ or ‘far’ and anthos ‘flower’ and refers to the long flowers.","Syncolostemon macranthus and S. latidens were noted to have the uppermost calyx tooth broadly ovate as in Hemizygia, formerly recognised as a separate genus, making the two species intermediate between Syncolostemon and Hemizygia. The family Lamiaceae consists of more than 240 genera and 6 500 species. Syncolostemon and Hemizygia after being merged into the one genus, Syncolostemon, enlarged the taxon, which currently consists of 44 species with 39 species, only known to occur in southern Africa. S. macranthus is mostly closely related to and confused with S. latidens, S. densiflorus and S. rotundifolius.",,"Syncolostemon macranthus is a decorative plant that is easy to grow, and ideal for either planting in the garden or as a potted specimen. Plant them densely together for thick and compact foliage in garden beds. This species performs very well in well-drained, composted rich soil and requires occasional water in summer. Feed with an organic fertilizer to improve the plant quality, in early spring. Pinch out spent inflorescence to encourage new growth and buds. Prune the tips of the branches to control and encourage growth. Few pests attack these plants

Syncolostemon macranthus is effectively propagated vegetatively by means of cuttings from softwood or herbaceous cuttings (tip and stem cuttings), in summer. To perform a successful propagation, you need to have a sterilized pair of secateurs/cutting tool, sterilizing agent, plastic bag, root stimulant/hormone powder and healthy and disease-free, mother stock. Take cuttings at the coolest time of the day, preferably mornings, when the plant is vigorous. Collect cuttings and dip them in water to prevent shock. Prepare well-drained soil, such as river sand mixed with perlite, sifted back, vermiculite or pebbles. Sterilize soil to prevent any soil-borne diseases, then make a cutting of 80 mm cutting below the node, remove a third of the leaves from the bottom to reduce transpiration/loss of moisture. Apply a rooting hormone and set the cuttings in the medium. Keep the cuttings in a warm, humid area with good air movement and keep the soil moist, but not wet. Rooting takes place after 2–3 weeks and once well-established, transplant cuttings into containers and water regularly until they are mature. Harden off in a semi-shaded area where there is sufficient flow of air. Established plants can be transplanted into larger containers or into the garden.

Sow seeds in a controlled environment, using well-drained soil in a seed tray. Use coarse bark at the bottom of the seed tray for better drainage. Add well-drained soil on top, water the medium well before sowing, spread the seeds on the surface of the media, then slightly cover with river sand and place in warm humid area with less wind Germination should take place in 4 to 5 weeks.","This species is a Drakensberg endemic and is regarded as rare because it has a narrow distribution range, but it is not considered to be threatened and therefore, Syncolostemon macranthus is red listed as Least Concern (LC).",,"There are no recorded traditional or medicinal uses, but Syncolostemon macranthus is widely used for its beautiful shape and lush flowers in the garden, mostly used on the margins of the garden and as back filler behind lower shrubs and ground covers, in full sun.

Raphia australis,Raphia australis,,"Tree, often up to 16 m tall, rarely stemless, usually solitary, monoecious (separate male and female flowers on the same tree), monocarpic (flowers once and dies). Leaves pinnate, often very large; petiole unarmed; rhachis with small ascending spines, leaflets reduplicate (central fold up, like an upside-down V), linear, 450-?650 x 50 mm, margin and midrib spiny. There are about 20 species of Raphia, mainly from tropical Africa and Madagascar; one comes from South America, and one is found in southern Africa, straddling the border between KwaZulu-Natal and Mozambique. the Kosi palm flowers once at an age of between 20 and 40 years, and then dies. The seasons do not seem to be of major importance in initiating flowering, but the trigger is unknown. Fruits remain on the tree generally until blown down by high winds, which may only happen a year or two after they are ripe.","The species epiphet australis means southern, not Australian, which is australiensis. It was only in 1968 that a Kosi palm tree in the Natal Herbarium garden in Durban was seen flowering, and it was realised that this was, in fact, a new species. Until that time it had been thought that the Mtunzini and Kosi Bay trees were the southernmost populations of Raphia vinifera Beauv., a West African species.","The inflorescence (flower spike) is covered by an enormous sheath up to 3m long, which falls away allowing the inflorescence to continue skywards (resembles a floral rocket launch!) Peduncle (flower stalk) covered by 2-ranked, imbricate, gaping bracts; branches and abbreviated flowering branchlets laterally compressed, laxly arranged or congested in one plane; bracts 2-ranked, imbricate. Flowers 2-ranked, female near base; males on upper part of spadix. Male flower with a 2-keeled bracteole; calyx tubular or 3-lobed; petals 3, free or nearly so; stamens 6 to many, free or joined. Female flower with an outer and an inner bracteole and a joined calyx and corolla; staminodial ring joined to corolla; anthers minute or not present; ovary 3-locular, with 1 ovule developing; style short with 3 stigmas or not present. Fruit 1-seeded, ovoid, 60-?90 x 30-?50 mm, covered with brown, imbricate scales arranged in vertical rows, each with a median groove; apex beaked. The natural distribution of the Kosi palm is restricted to a small area stretching from just south of Kosi Bay to 40 km or further north of Maputo. The population at Mtunzini is descended from cultivated trees. These trees are found on seasonally inundated dunes, and have pneumatophores (breathing roots) like mangroves.",,"These palms are dramatic accents in parks and large gardens, but are not suitable for containers or confined areas, as they are far too large for small gardens. Their natural habitat range suggests that they are frost sensitive, but some are to be seen in relatively cold situations around Kloof, Gillitts and Hillcrest in the Durban area. A witty comment in a horticultural description of a fishtail palm suggested that the latter make ideal street trees as they grow, flower and die within twenty years, which is about the usual length of time between renovations of the street layout. Much the same could be said of the Kosi palm, if it is given sufficient water, for the same reason. However it would probably be a bad choice for a shopping mall, as there the roads seem to be re-aligned much more often than every 20 years, and sufficient water would be a problem.

Fresh seed grows easily once the outer scales have been removed. Seedlings need filtered sunlight, plentiful water and protection from wind. Very little, if anything, else is known about the cultivation of these palms. In particular, I have yet to see one attacked by a pest or disease. However, untreated fruits used for ornament may eventually be subject to attack by cigarette beetles and other similar insects. The usual treatments (freezing, fumigation, insecticide spray) are adequate to control this provided that the damage is noticed in time.",,,The fruits are an important item in the food supply of the palm-nut vulture. ,,,,,
Gladiolus guthriei,Gladiolus guthriei,Gladiolus guthriei is quite strongly and sweetly scented and this scent persists at night," It is amongst the earliest winter bloomers and three to nine flowers are arranged on a tall stalk. They generally have a pale yellow or straw-coloured base colour, generously decorated with mauve or dark magenta streaks and speckles. The flowers are sweetly scented. Fruits develop at the base of the flower as it withers, and ripen into three-chambered seed capsules which open for dispersal, releasing the seeds about six weeks after flowering.
Gladiolus guthriei occurs naturally in the Cape Floristic Region, characterised by a Mediterranean climate, where winters are cool and wet and summers are hot and dry. It occurs in the Northwestern and Southwestern Cape from the Bokkeveld Mountains to Elim. Gladiolus guthriei can be seen flowering along Bains Kloof Pass, Dasklip Pass, above Porterville and on the Gifberg. It grows in rock crevices on sandstone outcrops at an altitude of 100-800 m.
","Gladiolus guthriei is listed as stable with a status of Least Concern in the Red List of South African Plants. The genus name Gladiolus is derived from the Latin word gladiolus, meaning little sword (gladius = sword), and refers to the sword-shaped leaves. Gladiolus guthriei was named for Francis Guthrie (1831-1899), a lawyer and professor of mathematics who assisted Harry Bolus and produced an extensive herbarium of the Cape Peninsula flora which is now housed at the University of Cape Town.","Gladiolus guthriei is a winter-growing, summer-dormant geophyte producing roots, leaves and flowers from an underground modified stem known as a corm. The corm is protected by fibrous modified leaves called tunics. The leaves are sword-shaped, fairly short and lightly hairy when young. However, during years when flowers are produced, resources are allocated to the flowers, and leaves are absent but for a few very short leaf stubs on the flowering stalk. Older plants that are not flowering in that year produce a long leathery leaf (G. Duncan 2012 pers. comm.). Plants can be 40-70 cm high including the flowering stalk.The flowering time for Gladiolus guthriei is during the autumn/winter months from April-June. Like many bulbous plants in the Cape Floristic Region, Gladiolus guthriei initiates new roots and leaves or flowering stalks in late summer and autumn when temperatures are lower and moisture is available in the form of dew deposits and rainfall. After flowering, seed production and dispersal, all aboveground growth disappears and the plants enter a period of dormancy. They survive the dry summers in the ground as a dormant storage organ containing buds and food reserves that enable them to grow vegetatively and produce flowers in the next favourable season. Gladiolus species are well adapted to natural fynbos fire cycles.",,"In the garden, Gladiolus guthriei will do best if grown in similar conditions to where it naturally occurs: in rocky, well-drained areas. Alternatively it can be grown in a container, preferring an acid, sandy growing medium such as three parts medium-grained river sand and one part fine acid compost or finely milled acid bark. Corms should be planted in autumn, from March to May, with April being the ideal month. The rule of thumb for geophytes is to plant them to a depth of three times the height of the rootstock. They should be watered well after planting and not again until the leaves have appeared above the surface of the soil, after which a good watering every seven to ten days is recommended. Gladiolus guthriei should be situated in a well ventilated, sunny position which receives full sun in the morning and shade in the afternoon.

As the season changes and temperatures begin to rise at the end of spring, watering should be reduced and the medium should be allowed to dry out completely during the summer dormant period.

Gladiolus guthriei can be propagated by seed sown during autumn, in the same sandy, well drained medium. Seeds should be sown in deep pots or trays to allow sufficient space for the developing bulbs. Fresh seeds germinate within four to five weeks. The plants produce flowers for the first time in the third or fourth growing season.",,,"There is no known specific cultural or medicinal use for Gladiolus guthriei. However, it is cultivated, particularly by bulb enthusiasts, and can be grown as a garden or container plant.",,,,,
Kalanchoe sexangularis,Kalanchoe sexangularis,,"Kalanchoe sexangularis is an evergreen, robust, water-wise, succulent shrublet. It grows upright on square stems that are green when young and become brown and flaky as they mature. The stems have a tendency to be lax and droopy and lie flat as the leaves become too large and heavy for the thin stems to support. It does not exceed heights of 1.5 m and has an unlimited spread, as that is the nature of its growth habit. Its attractive, broad, glossy and deeply serrated foliage reach lengths of 50–120 mm. When grown in shade the leaves tend to be greenish red, more green than red, but when in full sun, they tend to be ruby red. The leaves also turn red when there is a drop in temperature during the winter months.

It has small, yellow, tubular flowers on a tall, branched inflorescence seen in winter–spring (June–September), followed by fleshy, green seed capsules that turn brown and papery from late August onwards. This plant is a fast grower.

","The name of this genus is believed to be derived from the Chinese Kalan Chauhuy meaning ‘that which falls and grows’, likely referring to how many of the species in this genus have the ability to grow into mature plants from stems that have dropped. On the other hand, some believe it to be derived from the ancient Indian words kalanka meaning ‘spot or rust’ and chaya meaning ‘glossy’, referring to the reddish glossy leaves of the Indian species Kalanchoe laciniata. The specific epithet sexangularis meaning ‘6-angled’ is derived from the Latin words, sex meaning ‘six’ and angularis, meaning ‘angular’ or having ‘angles or corners’, which refers to the angled stems on this plant.",,,"This is a versatile plant in the garden. It can be used in borders, in rockeries or as a filler in mixed beds. It is suitable for coastal or bushveld gardens. It is a champion performer in water-wise gardens, and it is a good container plant.

This is a fast-growing plant and a beauty to have in the garden. Older plants every so often need a hard prune to keep growth tidy, as well as beautiful and lush. Some might say prune after flowering, but it is generally only necessary when material becomes old and untidy. This plant is a good contrasting plant, especially when combined with Kalanchoe longiflora, Curio crassulifolius, Oscularia deltoides, Cotyledon orbiculata and other grey-foliaged plants.

This plant can be propagated both sexually by seeds and asexually by cuttings. Seeds can be harvested from plants in winter, from July onwards, and left to dry and mature. Sow seeds in spring. When the seedlings are large enough to handle, transplant them directly into a garden bed, pot or bag. However, growing plants from seeds requires patience, and the quickest and preferred methods are by means of cuttings, dividing young suckers from motherplants and leaf cuttings. Suckers can be harvested throughout the year. Cut off a sucker of your size preference, remove a third of the lower foliage, place cutting in a dry place void of direct sunlight for ± a week and allow to callus. (Allowing suckers to callus avoids pathogens or diseases and also shortens the time it takes for plants to become established.) Place cuttings into a medium consisting of 40% river sand, 20% coarse, washed silica sand, 10% sifted bark, 15% perlite and 15% vermiculite. Keep cuttings in a well-lit place, away from direct sunlight for 2–3 weeks after they have rooted, whereafter they will be ready for direct sunlight and their final destination in the garden. Make use of all the material, allow nothing to go to waste; the leaves removed from suckers can be used as leaf cuttings. With leaf cuttings allow them to callus for ± a week, void of direct sunlight. Once callused, place the base of the leaf a quarter deep into the medium. In 4–5 weeks young shoots should be appearing where cuttings were inserted. Cuttings should be kept moist, but not soggy, in a cool, well-lit space.

Kalanchoe sexangularis is not prone to pests or diseases, but snails and slugs and various beetles have been observed feeding on the foliage. They can be physically removed or treated with a contact pesticide. Occasionally they are attacked by mealybug and soft scale which should be taken care of by means of a systemic pesticide as opposed to using a contact pesticide which will have minor effect as both insects have protective coverings.

Do not use liquid foliar feeds on this plant, as it tends to scorch or cause brown spots on the leaves; rather use a soil drench or granular feed, preferably organic.",,,,,,,,
Euryops chrysanthemoides,Euryops chrysanthemoides,,"A compact, densely branched, leafy, evergreen shrub, 0.5 to 2 m in height. The leaves are attractive, shaped rather like an oak leaf, with 7 to 9 deeply indented lobes and they are close-set, particularly on young growth.

The flowers are yellow daisies, 30-40 mm across with 15-30 bright yellow ray-florets and deep golden yellow disc-florets. They are carried well above the leaves on thin, wiry stalks 100-150 mm long. Peak flowering is in autumn-winter-spring (March to September) but flowers are usually found on the bush throughout the year.

Numerous small, ridged, black seeds are produced after flowering; they are shaped like a spindle with blunt ends. Euryops chrysanthemoides occurs in the Eastern Cape, along the coast and inland, to KwaZulu-Natal, Mpumalanga and Swaziland. It is usually found on forest edges, in riverine bush and in ravines, as well as in coastal scrub, grassland and disturbed areas.","The genus name Euryops is derived from the Greek eurys meaning large and ops an eye, referring to the large flowers. The species name chrysanthemoides means resembling a chrysanthemum. The genus Chrysanthemum means gold flower from the Greek chrysos gold and anthemon a flower.

The name resin bush is applied generally to Euryops species and is a direct translation from the Dutch name harpuis bosch from the Dutch word hars (resin) and puisje (a small pimple), referring to the resinous secretion exuding from the stem and branches in the form of small pimply drops.","Euryops is a member of the daisy family (Asteraceae) and consists of 97 species that occur in Africa with one that extends into the Arabian Peninsula and Socotra. There are 89 species in southern Africa where they are widespread. Other species at Kirstenbosch include: E. pectinatus, E. virgineus, E. annae, E. abrotanifolius, E. tysonii, E. linearis and E. speciosissimus and a hybrid between E. pectinatus and E. chrysanthemoides called 'Kirstenbosch'.",,"A vigorous, hardy, free-flowering shrub that tolerates brackish, poor and dry soils, but for it to perform at its best, plant it in a sunny situation in good, compost-enriched soil. To keep it neat and to stimulate new growth and therefore more flowers, prune hard in late winter-spring after its peak flowering period. Dead-heading will prolong flowering. It responds very well to foliar feeding, organic or inorganic fertilisers and occasional deep irrigation once it is established. In South Africa it can be considered frost hardy, but in colder climates it probably will not survive outdoors where there is a winter minimum lower than -1 to -7 °C (zone 9).

Plant Euryops chrysanthemoides as a specimen shrub in groups of three or five, or use it to form an informal low hedge, e.g. around a building where you don't want to obscure the windows, or along pathway or a driveway, or to finish off a shrub border, or plant it as part of the backdrop for a herbaceous border.

Easy to propagate by seed sown in spring or summer, or cuttings taken in early spring. It seeds itself freely, and these seedlings are easily transplanted to other parts of the garden.",,,"Although there are no recorded uses for this species, other Euryops species were used in the past and this species was quite likely used in the same way. Euryops species are rich in resin, which sometimes appears as blobs on the stems and twigs. This resin was greatly esteemed at one time, by both the Khoi and the colonists, for its alleged medicinal properties. It was used as a substitute gum, and to preserve leather, like boots and saddles.",,,,,
Protea eximia,Protea eximia,,"Protea eximia is a large, upright shrub, 2-5 m tall with a single main trunk and a rather lanky, sparsely branched growth habit. The leaves are greyish green to purplish green and are coated with a whitish bloom that can be rubbed off (glaucous). The leaves are leathery and hairless, narrowly to broadly egg-shaped, 60-100 x 30-65 mm. The base of the leaf, where it attaches to the petiole, is heart-shaped with a deep notch where the petiole is inserted (cordate), and in some plants the two rounded lobes at the base of the leaf are ear-shaped and project quite prominently (auriculate).

The flower heads are large, 100-140 mm long, and up to 120 mm across when fully opened. The outer surfaces of the floral bracts are covered in fine silky hairs (sericeous) and the margins are fringed with hairs (ciliate). The outer series of floral bracts (those lower down on the flower head) are usually greenish or yellowish white or white flushed with pink, with a brown edge. The inner series of floral bracts are long and spoon-shaped, and usually deep pink, although colour varies in wild populations from pink to orange-brown. When the flower head opens, there is a central dark purple ring in the centre.

This is because the tips of the long, narrow flowers massed in the centre of the flower head are covered in purple-black, velvety hairs. At first, no flowers are open and they are all massed together in the centre, so the purple colour is very pronounced. The flowers open from the outside inwards, and as they do so the perianth (with the purple hairs) collapses and separates from the central mass, so the purple ring becomes less pronounced and the colour more diffuse as the flowers open. The collapsed perianths are the thread-like structures that can be seen falling between the floral bracts, and they cause the older flower heads to look rather untidy.

Flowering time is mainly during spring to early summer (August to October) but flower heads are found on the bushes from midwinter until midsummer (June until December).","The genus Protea was named by Linnaeus after the Greek god Proteus who could change his form at will, because the proteas are so different in form. The species name eximia is Latin and means distinguished, excellent or extraordinary - clearly this species made a good impression on Richard Salisbury who proposed the name. Protea eximia was discovered by James Niven in the Swartberg, probably soon after 1805. He sent seed back to Lee and Kennedy's Nursery in London and the plants flowered in 1809. J.W. Mathews, curator of Kirstenbosch from 1913 until 1936, introduced P. eximia to the garden in 1914 from seed that he collected on the Swartberg Pass.","Protea eximia is easy to tell apart from other proteas by its cordate to auriculate, hairless leaves, spoon-shaped floral bracts and purple-centred flower head. It is most often confused with the hybrids Sylvia and Cardinal, which are hybrids between itself and P. susannae and they have inherited its purple-centred flower head but not its foliage. Protea eximia is widespread throughout the mountains of the southern Cape, from the Keeromsberg near Worcester, along the Langeberg, Outeniqua and Tzitzikamma Mountains to Van Stadensberg near Port Elizabeth. It is also found on the Waboomsberg, Klein Swartberg, Rooiberg, Groot Swartberg, Kamanassie and Kouga Mountains and Strydomsberg. Within its distribution range, rainfall varies from 380 mm to 1000 mm per year. P. eximia occurs in dense stands on sandstone slopes, 200-1600 m above sea level. It is found growing in many different habitats, from dense well-watered fynbos at low altitudes, to sparse, arid fynbos on the high mountains where light frost and snowfalls occur during the winter months. Fynbos is fire-adapted and plants have developed different strategies to survive fires, the main two being reseeding and resprouting. A reseeder is usually single-stemmed at ground level and the whole plant is killed by the fire, but it produces large numbers of seeds that are often stored on the bush during its lifetime and germinate en masse after a fire. A resprouter is usually multi-stemmed at ground level and although the above-ground parts of the plant are killed, it has a large underground rootstock, known as a lignotuber, which survives and sends out vigorous new growth soon after the fire. Protea eximia is a reseeder. It holds the previous year's seeds in the old flower heads, which are stored on the bush.



",,"Protea eximia is good cut flower, with long-lasting flower heads and long stems, and is cultivated for the export market. There is a degree of variation within the species with different forms of it around. A very striking form that has been named is P. eximia 'Fiery Duchess' with blue-grey foliage and very deep reddish pink floral bracts. P. eximia is also the parent in a number of hybrids e.g. P. eximia x susannae 'Sylvia', P. eximia x susannae 'Cardinal' and P. compacta x eximia 'Pink Duke'.

Protea eximia is one of the easier proteas to cultivate as it tolerates quite a wide range of soils and conditions, as well as wind and light frost. Plant it in a sunny position, in well-drained soil where there is free air circulation. Water well throughout the year but particularly during autumn-winter-spring. Like other proteas it is a light feeder with a sensitive root system that is adapted to very nutrient-poor soils. It will not tolerate strong fertilizers and manures, but should be fed with well-rotted compost and if using chemical fertilizers, choose a slow-release one or apply very low doses.

Tip young plants regularly to encourage branching. Remove the spent flower heads immediately after flowering to encourage a more compact bush. Also, as it can be a bit lanky and sparsely branched, plant in close groups of three or five so the plants can support each other and achieve a more dense bush. It is a long-lived protea, and can reach 20 or 30 years and show no signs of senescence.

Grow Protea eximia in the fynbos garden, the coastal garden, the water-wise garden or in gardens with alkaline soils where most mountain proteas fail. It tolerates brief, light frosts and can therefore be grown successfully in Highveld gardens and should survive outdoors in Zone 9 (-7 to -1°C / 20 to 30°F). It can be grown in the shrubbery, towards the back of a mixed border, and produces a steady supply of cut flowers during winter to early summer.

Protea eximia can be propagated by seed or cuttings. Sow seed in autumn to early summer, in well-drained soil, lightly covered with clean sand or fine-milled bark and kept moist but not wet. Germination occurs after 3 weeks. Treating the seed with a fungicide increases the number of surviving seedlings. Transplant into individual containers as soon as the first pair of true leaves have developed. Seedlings grow rapidly and the first flowers can be expected in their second or third year.

Take semi-hardwood cuttings from the current season's growth, in autumn or spring. Remove the leaves from the basal third of the cutting, treat with a rooting hormone, and place in a well-drained rooting medium under intermittent mist with a bottom heat of 25°C.

Protea eximia leaves are prone to attack and disfigurement by leaf miners.",,,,,,,,
Liparia angustifolia,Liparia angustifolia,,"A slender shrublet that grows to 30 cm high. The branches are lanate (woolly) with linear to narrowly lanceolate, prickly leaves. Yellow flowers are borne on hairy pedicels in a short capitate raceme. A distinguishing feature of this plant is that the flower bracts are longer than the pedicel and do not clasp the base of the calyx. Liparia angustifolia flowers in summer (October to December) and seed is generally harvested 3 months after flowering. The light brown, bean-shaped seeds are released from hairy seed pods, 20 mm in length. They use a ballistic method of seed release: once the seed pods are dry they explode releasing the seeds into the environment.","Liparia is a member of the Fabaceae or legume family, a large family of 650 genera and 18 000 species. The genus name Liparia is derived from the Greek word liparos which means 'shiny' or 'oily'; this refers to the hairless leaves of the genus. The species epithet angustifolia is from the Latin angustus meaning `narrow' and folium meaning `leaf'. Thus the name Liparia angustifolia means `shiny narrow leaf'.

In 1825 De Can dolle placed one species in Liparia and placed the rest of the previous Liparia species under the genera Priestleya, Rafnia or Borbonia. Later, in 1967 J.J. Bos revised the genus and added two species: L. splendens, divided into two subspecies, and L. parva. A study into the pollination mechanisms of these two species led to a 1997 revision of Priestleya and Liparia by Schutte. It was found that the species were in fact similar and Schutte returned Priestleya angustifolia to the genus Liparia, in which 21 species are at present listed.","Liparia angustifolia, like many legumes, has nodules on its roots that fix nitrogen into the soil. The main pollinator of Liparia angustifolia is the carpenter bee, although other insects such as flies have been seen on the flowers. L. angustifolia is a reseeding shrublet and a resprouter. It uses both of these recruitment methods to survive fires; as the above ground parts of the plants are killed, the underground rootstock survives and produces shoots after the fire. The seeds are stimulated to germinate after a fire. The seeds of Liparia have an elaiosome which is attractive to ants, which carry the seeds underground and store them in their nests; this protects the seeds from the fire. An easy way to distinguish seedlings from resprouting plants is to count the number of stems. Those grown from seed only have a single stem whilst the resprouters have multiple stems and will flower sooner.",,"Liparia angustifolia is not commonly cultivated due to its rarity and consequent high conservation status. It also has no known medicinal or other uses.

This shrub it not easy to grow and the best results are achieved by copying its natural habitat requirements. It likes damp, acidic soils and needs lots of water in the winter months. It is best to grow it in flower beds in full sun or half-day shade with larger plants protecting it. Feed with an organic fertiliser and apply a mulch of well-rotted compost in spring and autumn. As fire rejuvenates older plants, mimic this by cutting the old woody stems, in the summer months, back to the rootstock and leave a few younger stems to sustain the plant.

Liparia angustifolia does not do well long-term in a container and it is recommended to plant it directly into a garden bed.

Liparia angustifolia can be propagated from seed or cuttings. Seed needs to be scarified before sowing as this will allow moisture through the seed coat and aid in germination. Sandpapering the seed coat lightly or making a shallow cut in the coat with a sharp blade will give the desired results. Next, soak the seed in warm water for 12 hours. The seed can be sown in late summer or early autumn (March-May) on a medium of sterile milled pine bark and riversand. It is important to keep the medium moist and to treat it with a fungicide to prevent loss of seedlings. Transplanting the seedlings must be done at an early age whilst still in the cotyledon stage.

Semi-hardwood heel cuttings are best taken from the rootstock or as close to the rootstock as possible. This should be done in spring to early summer or late summer to autumn. Place cuttings in a well-drained medium of milled pine bark and polystyrene. Treating the cuttings with a rooting hormone for semi-hardwood material will result in a better rooting percentage. It is best to root the cuttings directly into a large container to prevent unnecessary disturbance to the roots.",,,,,,,,
Salvia albicaulis,Salvia albicaulis,aromatic leaves,"Relatively fast growing, Salvia albicaulis is a much branched shrub, 0.5 m or higher. It has an upright, neat habit. Multiple stems grow from a slightly woody rootstock. The stems are noticeably square and have a white appearance, one of the prominent distinguishing characteristics of the species. Fine, short, dense hairs lie flat, covering the stem. No glands are present.

The leaves are simple, fairly thick and have a leathery texture. The shape of the leaves varies from egg-shaped to rounded or spatula-shaped with irregular blunt, rounded projections to sharp-toothed margins. No hairs are present on the top of the leaves but the undersides can have short bristly hairs. The underside of mature leaves appears white with prominent venation.

The inflorescence is branched, producing up to 8 whorls of 2 or 3 purplish flowers in summer. Floral leaves are lance-shaped and soon fall off, but bracts remain present. The calyx is bell-shaped and densely covered in long, white, glandless hairs. The flowers are mauve. The calyx does not expand much in fruit which consists of three nutlets about 2 mm across.They fall out when ripe.","Pliny the Elder, a Roman scientist and historian, was the first to use the name Salvia. The name Salvia is derived from the Latin, salvus, meaning uninjured, whole, safe, well or sound and salvere, to be in good health), referring to the medicinal value of the plants.

The epithet albicaulis comes from the Latin albus (white) and caulis (stem), referring to thedistinguishing white stems of the species.","The white-stemmed sage is found from Clanwilliam to Tulbagh and is an endemic. It occurs at altitudes of 200-1100 m in well-drained soils on rocky slopes. Salvia is the largest genus in the Lamiaceae family. The genus Salvia consists of approximately 900 species made up of annuals, perennials and shrubs. They are widely distributed around the world in warm temperate and tropical regions. Twenty-seven species are found naturally in South Africa. Noteworthy South African sages are Salvia africana-lutea, S. africana-caerulea, S. chamelaeagnea, S. muirii and S. thermarum. Sages are commonly grown as ornamentals.

Bees and insects are attracted to Salvia flowers.

",,"The white-stemmed sage can be used as an attractive summer flowering shrub in an herbaceous border planting in large or small gardens. Plants positioned in backlight show off the hairy, light purple calyx with dramatic effect. They make good container specimens and can grow in large, well-drained pots for many years before needing replacement. Salvia albicaulis will make a good rockery specimen, and is hardy and water-wise.

New plants are planted out at the end of spring. Salvia albicaulis is easily combined with most yellow, white or pink flowering perennials such Lasiospermum bipinnatum, Diascia integerrima and Dimorphotheca jucunda. They also give good contrast with fynbos elements such as Restionaceae, Proteaceae and Erica species.

The plants may need to be pruned back lightly each year to encourage bushy growth.

Salvia albicaulis requires full sun with good drainage. It will survive with little water but responds well to regular watering, especially in summer. No extra feeding is necessary for strong, healthy growth but an occasional foliar feed would do no harm and the plants will tolerate general chemical fertilizing.

New plants are easy to propagate from seed and cuttings.

Sow seeds in late spring and early summer into general potting soil mix. Seedlings germinate quickly and can be transplanted into well-drained potting soil once the first pair of true leaves appears.

Take semi-hardwood tip cuttings in spring and summer. Cuttings must be without terminal flowering buds. Place in rooting medium, 50% fine-milled bark and 50% polystyrene (perlite, vermiculite, river sand and peat are alternatives). Place under mist or enclose in plastic bag to retain humidity. Keep warm but out of direct sunlight. Cuttings should root in 2-4 weeks.",,,"The virtues of sages can been found, in old herbal woodcuts and engravings of medieval and Renaissance Europe, giving medicinal recipes or describing charms or spells. Salvias have been popular since the 1970's for ornamental gardening.

Most sages contain essential oils and have long been used in cooking and medicine all over the world.

Lachenalia pustulata,Lachenalia pustulata,Sweetly scented,"It consists of a single white fleshy bulb about 10-20 mm in diameter, with fine white adventitious roots, and two strap-like lanceolate leaves growing up to 150 mm long. Unlike certain Lachenalia species which sometimes have dark blotches on the leaves, those of this species are always plain green. Depending on the locality, they often have little bumps or pustules on the upper surface of the leaf, hence the specific name. The leaves will start to emerge a few weeks after the first rains in autumn, and wither naturally in late spring/early summer. The inflorescence can grow up to about 200 mm tall and, depending on the form, appears from early to late spring. The fruit are small capsules that ripen a month or two after flowering to release small shiny black seeds.

Flower colour varies depending on the locality, sometimes differing quite significantly within the space of a few kilometres. Certain forms can be nondescript, usually in monotone shades of pale yellow, dull white or a pale dusky pink. Other monotone forms, however, can be quite striking, like the mauve-pink form from Paternoster or the pure white form from Stellenbosch. Then there are multicoloured forms that can be quite spectacular, like one from Blaauwberg Hill, with the uppermost flowers deep cerise, lightening through shades of pink, turquoise, yellow, green and white with older flowers fading to dull brown.","The genus Lachenalia was first described and named by Joseph Franz Jacquin in the late 1700s in honour of Werner de Lachenal, a professor of Botany in Basel, Switzerland. Lachenalia pustulata was one of the species described by Jacquin, the specific epithet pustulata referring to the bumps or blisters on the upper surface of the leaf.","The genus Lachenalia is generally restricted to the winter-rainfall parts of South Africa and Namibia. L. pustulata is found only in the south-western Western Cape, ranging from the St Helena Bay District in the north through Saldanha, Riebeek Kasteel and Malmesbury to the Worcester District in the east and southwards to the Cape Peninsula. Like all other Lachenalia species, L. pustulata is a conventional winter-growing bulb that is summer-deciduous, i.e. it becomes completely dormant during the hot dry summer months in the Mediterranean-type climate of the Western Cape.

L. pustulata typically grows on hill slopes and flats in stony clay soils, which helps prevent predation by moles and/or porcupines. They are sweetly scented and are pollinated by bees, amongst other agents.",,"L. pustulata is very easy to grow and one of the most robust and most rewarding species to grow as a pot subject. The soil medium should be fairly well drained and consist of about half coarse washed sand and half finely sieved compost. This should be used to fill the lower two-thirds of the pot. The upper third should be pure sand with no loam or compost into which the bulbs are planted. This layer stays relatively dry preventing the bulbs from rotting if they should get too wet, while the roots can safely penetrate the richer moister organic medium below. They should be kept in full sun and will grow very happily outside during the winter months, providing the temperature does not drop below freezing. In summer the bulbs should be kept dry, preferably in a cool position. One can either lift the bulbs and store them in paper bags or store them in their pots. They enjoy being repotted every 2-3 years with fresh medium.

They are easily propagated by leaf cuttings, which can be removed from the plant by slicing them at the base of the leaf blade. These leaves are then half buried in a very sandy medium and left in a cool place out of direct sunlight. The soil should be kept on the dry side to avoid the leaves rotting, while the humidity can be quite high: humid air and dry soil is the trick. Within a few months, small bulbils will appear along the cut edge at the base of the leaf. Eventually the leaf will wither but the bulbils can be planted like normal bulbs the following season. Flowering will take 1-2 years.

They are also easily raised from seed, which should be sown in autumn in a similar medium used for cultivation with a thin layer of soil placed over the seed. Water them gently but regularly in the first few weeks. The seedlings should germinate within about 2-3 weeks. Flowering will take 2-3 years.

They don't have many pests apart from snails and caterpillars (which can be removed by hand) and mealy bug which should be treated with a systemic pesticide. A rust fungus can be problematic and appears as orange blotches on the leaves, often developing where a leaf has been damaged by hail for example. This is easily preventable (preferable) or treatable with common fungicides.

Not much fertilising is required for these bulbs as they are not generally very demanding, but they would respond well to small doses of a dilute low-nitrogen liquid fertiliser.",,,,,,,,
Spotted Nettle,Laportea grossa,,"Laportea grossa is a herbaceous perennial or annual, up to 1 m tall, with soft, upright stems armed with downward-pointing stinging hairs. It has a sprawling, spreading growth habit, with stems rooting at the nodes. Leaves are alternate, triangular and coarsely toothed, and are also armed with stinging hairs. Most plants, like the selection grown at Kirstenbosch, have conspicuous white spots on the leaves, but not all wild individuals boast spotted leaves. There is a stinging hair in the centre of each white spot, and there are stinging hairs on the lower surface of the leaves, particularly along the three main veins, as well as near the petiole and on the petiole. The stinging hairs of Laportea grossa are mounted on long, slender protuberances-a characterstic that the other two southern African species do not share. Laportea grossa is monoecious, meaning that there are male flowers and female flowers, separate from each other, but both the male and female occur on the same plant. The flowers are in panicles (branched inflorescences) in the axils of the leaves. Small and greenish, they are not decorative but are noticeable. Flowering time is midsummer to autumn (Dec.-Mar.).The male flowers are more rounded, paler yellowish green and more noticeable than the female flowers, which are narrower and greener. The male flower is 2 mm in diameter, regular in shape, with 4 or 5 equal tepals and 5 white puffy stamens that stick out when ripe.The female flower is 1.5 mm long, with 4 unequal tepals, one pair of tepals is much larger than the other one, and the tepals of the smaller pair are of unequal size. A white style can be seen protruding from the female flowers. Each female flower produces a single, small, dry, thin-coated seed, ± 1.7 mm long that is shed with the tepals still attached.","The genus Laportea is named after an unidentified person called Laporte, possibly a companion of Gaudichaud on the voyage of the corvette L'Uranie in 1817-1820. The species name grossa means large. Laportea belongs in the nettle family (Urticaceae) and consists of ± 50 species, spread throughout the tropical regions of the world and extending into the temperate regions of North America and East Asia.","Laportea grossa grows in moist, shady places in coastal forest, forest, closed woodland and near streams from George in the Western Cape, through the Eastern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal and Mpumalanga as far north as Kenya. The genus Laportea is named after an unidentified person called Laporte, possibly a companion of Gaudichaud on the voyage of the corvette L'Uranie in 1817-1820. The species name grossa means large. Laportea belongs in the nettle family (Urticaceae) and consists of ± 50 species, spread throughout the tropical regions of the world and extending into the temperate regions of North America and East Asia.","A nettle sting contains a hollow hair stiffened with silica and the chemicals that cause the sting are in the swollen base of the hair. When the hair is touched, the brittle tip breaks, exposing a sharp point that penetrates the skin and injects the toxin. The toxin in the stinging nettle Urtica dioica was believed to be formic acid but is now thought to consist of a histamine, acetylcholine and serotonin.","Laportea grossa is a plant of the forest floor and needs full to light shade or dappled shade, well-drained, fertile, well-composted soil and lots of water, particularly during the summer months. Gardeners in the winter rainfall areas will have to feed and water this plant in summer for it to perform at its best. Grow it in a cool, well-drained but well-watered, shady area where its lovely, glossy, white-spotted foliage will stand out. Choose an out-of-the-way position where it is unlikely to be encountered-unless you wish to try and exploit its repellent characteristics. Although it is also suitable to be grown in a container on a shady patio or courtyard, or indoors, its stinging stems and leaves make it an unfriendly house guest.

Laportea grossa is not a popular plant to propagate. Nevertheless it is not that difficult to work with it and not get stung. Use thick gardening gloves, or washing up gloves, or the new generation gardening gloves that combine latex and cloth. Experienced propagators know the knack of dealing with these unfriendly plants-take hold of the stem firmly and quickly, crushing the stinging hairs before they can penetrate the skin. It is the slower, more hesitant approach that results in stung fingers.

Laportea grossa is very easy to propagate from cuttings. Take stem cuttings (all growth is soft) at any time of the year, treat with a rooting hormone for herbaceous material and place in the mist unit. The cuttings root in ± 2 weeks. It is trickier to grow them on in the nursery because it is difficult to find a spot that suits them. They need to be cool, get no direct sun and be moist but not wet. Use a well-drained soil medium-it must drain freely-and water them frequently but make sure that the soil is not soggy or waterlogged.

Because cuttings are so easy, it has not been propagated from seed at Kirstenbosch. Seed should be sown as soon as it is ripe, in a well-drained soil medium, covered lightly, and kept moist and cool.

",,,"The spotted nettle has been used to punish boys, and to produce sexual irritation in cattle. The young tips are cooked and eaten as a vegetable.Its use as a deterrent of human traffic is probably not as effective as a thorny shrub such as Carissa macrocarpa or Dovyalis caffra whose thorns are both conspicuous and sharp","The pain inflicted by the spotted nettle is a sharp, burning sting that lasts a while and can cause temporary redness on the skin.",Trevor Adams and Cherise Viljoen,,,
Mimetes hirtus,Mimetes hirtus,,"Mimetes hirtus is a single-stemmed, erect, much-branched shrub, 1.0-2.5 m in height with smooth, reddish bark. The branches possess numerous upwardly overlapping, lanceolate leaves, 25-45 x 5-18 mm, that hide the stem almost completely. The leaves and stem are covered in tiny hairs, and the leaf edges are ciliate.

The headlets or groups of flowers are borne in the axils of the uppermost foliage leaves of a flowering branch. There are nine to fourteen flowers in the headlet; each of these being surrounded by bright yellow, tube-shaped bracts with red tips, from which the 50-55 mm long red styles, needle-shaped pollen presenter and fluffy white perianth extend. This composition is known as a 'brush type pseudanthium' and is the least specialized of the flower types of Mimetes.

The inconspicuous green leaf that subtends the flower does not change shape or colour during the flowering period (as is the case in the more advanced mimetes flower types). The tips of the flowering branches are crowned by a flattened crest of soft, rusty brown leaves without flowers in their axils, hence the common name, pineapple bush.

Flowering takes place mainly in winter, in July and August, although it can occur anytime between May and November.","The first written record of Mimetes hirtus dates back to 1672, when Paul Hermann of the Dutch East India Company visited Cape Town . His notes on two species describe plant features that can only be attributed to M. hirtus and M. cucullatus . In 1720, Herman Boerhaave's collection of engravings was published. An illustration of M. hirtus featured here in the group named Hypophyllocarpodendron (tree with fruits under the leaves). The botanical accuracy of the engravings may be questionable, but Boerhaave's habitat description 'in marshes, damp places and indeed, in water itself, grows this five to six foot tree of Africa' confirms the species to be M. hirtus . Carl Linnaeus described and named the plant in 1760 after he received a herbarium specimen as a gift. He named the plant Leucadendron hirtum , the specific epithet meaning hairy, after its hairy stems, possibly because the only other species of the genus described at the time was the hairless M. cucullatus (then called Leucadendron cucullatum ).

R.A. Salisbury established Mimetes as a genus in 1807 after subdividing Linnaeus's genus Leucadendron. The name was derived from a Greek word meaning imitator, copyist, or one who represents characters i.e. an actor or dancer. Since men played the roles of both males and females on the Greek stage, the word was assigned a masculine gender, and Salisbury gave masculine endings to the species he described. Following this, Brown in 1810 and the authors of Flora capensis in 1912 interpreted Mimetes as feminine, hence the name Mimetes hirta can be found in old literature. It is now considered correct to revert to the masculine endings initially assigned and so the name Mimetes hirtus prevails once again.","M. hirtus is a relatively short-lived member of the protea family. It grows rapidly as a result, and may start flowering after only two years of growth. Plants reach their peak by ten years of age and die shortly thereafter, at a maximum age of about fifteen years. Fruits are generally ripe within five months following pollination, a rate faster than other species in the genus.

The species is well conserved at the Cape of Good Hope Nature Reserve that forms part of the Table Mountain National Park, and in the Kogelberg Biosphere Reserve. The population in the Kleinmond Nature Reserve requires monitoring as it may be at risk from the effects of eutrophication. It has been assigned a lower Red Data List status than many of the other species in the genus, but Rourke (1982) considers it to be the most seriously threatened. Strict criteria give it a status of Vulnerable owing mainly to its low-lying areas of occurrence that often clash with urbanization and agricultural development (orchards and pastures). It cannot be termed Endangered as most of its habitat loss occurred over three generations ago. Other major threats include alien invasive plants, wetland drainage and groundwater extraction as well as golf courses, afforestation and eutrophication. Since it is sought after as a cut flower, wild flower harvesting is an added threat. Alien invasive ants pose a problem, as they do not aid seed dispersal, a process in which indigenous ants play a vital role in Mimetes.

Mimetes hirtus is endemic to the winter rainfall Cape Floral Region where it favours seeps and bogs in coastal lowlands and coastal mountain slopes (0-400 m). Seven populations remain in the Cape Peninsula and Houwhoek Centres of Endemism, where it is found in particular abundance at Cape Point and in Betty's Bay. It is extinct in the present-day southern suburbs of the City of Cape Town : Rondebosch (last record 1800), Klaasenbosch (last record 1884) and Wynberg (last record unknown) and presumed extinct in Hermanus and Elim. These losses can possibly be attributed to its habitat preference. Dense local stands usually occur on Table Mountain Sandstone in areas where it obtains groundwater inflow from surrounding slopes, also known as Erica-Osmitopsis Seepage Fynbos (Boucher 1978). It is thus ensured a high soil moisture level, even in the dry summers when the black, peaty, acid fynbos soils retain their moisture and remain damp. Mimetes hirtus is one of thirteen species in the genus and is grouped together with the other tube pagodas, M. pauciflorus, M. palustris and M. capitulatus . The brightly coloured, tube-shaped bracts surrounding the flowers and the lack of display function of the leaf subtending the flower, distinguish these from the other Mimetes species.

All species in the genus Mimetes are endemic to the Cape Floral Region and at present only three of these are not threatened with extinction. Of particular interest is the silver pagoda, M. stokoei, which was thought to be extinct after the last remaining plant of the population was killed in 1969. However, after lying dormant underground for approximately three fire cycles, its seeds exhibited remarkable longevity and germinated in 2001, following a suitable fire in 1999.

All members of the genus Mimetes have evolved flowerheads adapted to pollination by birds. The brightly coloured bracts and styles in shades of red and yellow that are visually attractive to birds, and the diurnal production of large quantities of nectar, provide evidence for this. Sunbirds appear to be the primary pollinators of most Mimetes, while the Cape Sugarbird (Promerops cafer) only visits some species. Conversely, in the case of M. hirtus , the Cape Sugarbird has been proven to be the major pollinator of populations at Betty's Bay, while the Orange-Breasted Sunbird ( Nectarinia violacea ) seems to play a less important role in effecting pollination. These findings could be attributed to the foraging behaviour of the birds as well as the territorial nature of Promerops cafer . The latter was observed foraging on the axillary flowers while perched above the flowerhead. In doing so, the bird reaches down over the stigmata and pollen presenters and brushes its head and throat against them. The Orange-Breasted Sunbird was seen foraging from below or next to the flowers and rarely brushed against the styles or pollen presenters while probing the flowers with its beak. The Cape Sugarbird also exhibited a preference for partially opened flowers as these flowers provide the greatest nectar rewards. Of significance to the plant is the increased likelihood of the bird collecting viable pollen from flowers that are at an early stage of development, as availability of viable pollen on the presenters is greatest at this time. The only invertebrates noted were hemipterans, and they rarely moved onto the styles (Collins 1982). It is unlikely that invertebrates play a deliberate role in pollination.

Invertebrates are essential to the survival of the species, however, as indigenous ants (particularly Anoplolepis custodiens) have a symbiotic association with the plants through which they play a vital role in seed dispersal. The single-seeded fruit of Mimetes hirtus possesses a hard, greyish seed coat surrounded by a soft coating derived from the wall of the ovary. Fleshy thickenings may be observed at both ends of the fruit and these, together with the soft outer coating, function as an elaiosome (strictly speaking an elaiosome is a term given to a chemically attractive appendage of a seed and since Mimetes produces single-seeded fruit, the fleshy parts cannot be called an elaiosome). When the fruits are released, they fall to the ground, and within a few hours the membranous outer layer or pericarp dries. This time constraint does not pose a problem for the ants, however, as they detect the fruit within minutes and quickly alert the rest of the colony, from which assistance is required to drag it into the nest underground. The ants then eat off the fleshy parts and leave the remaining fruit. In doing so, the ants disperse the fruit away from the parent plant and protect it from predators, i.e. birds and rodents, and fire.

Mimetes hirtus forms part of fynbos, a fire-adapted flora. The adult plants are reseeders and hence unable to resprout from a rootstock. As such, they are killed by fire, and the survival of their fruit is essential for survival of the species (hence the importance of the role of the ants). The fruit are able to live for long periods of time underground and germinate after fire, when they are triggered by various cues such as changes in temperature, pH and oxygen levels in the ants' nest.

Since the species exhibits early flowering and senescence, it necessitates being burnt every 15 years, although it can also survive more frequent fires, depending on whether sufficient time is allowed for seedlings that germinated following the previous fire to flower and set seed.",,"Mimetes hirtus has been grown fairly successfully in cultivation, although it does have specific requirements. Since it is a marsh-growing species, it needs extra water and thus prefers areas with high soil moisture content but that still permit free drainage to ensure aeration of the roots. These conditions are not easy to simulate and the position of planting thus requires careful consideration.

Propagation and cultivation

The plants can be propagated from seeds, although given that these are difficult to acquire, propagation by means of cuttings is the preferred method. Cuttings should be either stem tip cuttings or side shoots taken as heel cuttings. The latter are cuttings taken where a side shoot or short twig is pulled off the main stem in such a way that part of the main stem comes off along with the cutting, hereby giving the appearance of a heel.

The cutting material must be 100-120 mm long, approximately as thick as a pencil, and should be young but not too soft. Apply the 'little finger test' i.e. material should resist when one attempts to bend it with one's little finger. A good time to take cuttings is February/March when the new shoots have emerged and hardened off but before buds have formed for winter flowers. The cuttings must be kept cool after harvesting and it is advisable to keep them in a refrigerator for up to two days before setting. Cuttings must be treated with a rooting hormone prior to setting in a rooting medium of 50:50 milled pine bark with polystyrene for drainage and placement in well-aerated mist units with heating under the trays. It is essential that they are kept damp in the mist unit. Mimetes hirtus is not too difficult to root providing the correct methods are followed. Rooting may start after six weeks but can take up to three or four months.

In the event of callous formation but no roots, remove the cutting, damage the callous, and reapply rooting hormone. Place the cutting in a clean rooting medium and rooting should take place soon thereafter. Once the cuttings have rooted, they should be hardened off for three weeks, then planted into suitable containers.The planted cuttings should be kept wet at all times.

The planting medium should consist of sands with a high humic and low nutrient content. This can be attained by using black soil (when available) to which a small amount of peat (maximum 20%) can be added. Do not add compost to the soil. Add mulch on top of the planting soil in the container. Alternatively, a sandy fynbos mix can be created using acid river sand and composted pine bark or pine needles in equal parts.

Feed the plants every six weeks with ammonium sulphate and magnesium sulphate by dissolving three to four heaped teaspoons of each in 10 litres water and give each plant a cupful at a time. This will ensure a good balance of growth between roots and leaves. Water them regularly (at this stage they do not need their feet wet all the time but must not be allowed to dry out) and prune them after flowering; pruning will result in a fuller bush and hence more flowering shoots in the next season (Adriaan Hanekom and Anthony Hitchcock pers. comm.).

Pests: Mimetes hirtus is very susceptible to the root rot fungus Phytophthora. In order to overcome this problem they should be planted in large pots in a sterilized planting medium. Water in the mornings as at this time the water applied is approximately the same temperature as the soil-avoid subjecting the plants to sudden changes in temperature as these may aid fungal growth. No other serious pests have been reported by Adriaan Hanekom, manager of the Caledon Fynbos Nursery.

Planting: The plants may need toughening up prior to being planted out in a garden. Expose them to sunlight and fewer nutrients if necessary.

Anthony Hitchcock, Kirstenbosch Nursery Manager, recommends planting Mimetes hirtus along a shallow natural drainage line where extra runoff water accumulates. Provide protection from excessive heat by planting it together with plants that give a certain degree of cooling shade, for instance Chondropetalum tectorum, Elegia capensis, Erica perspicua, Osmitopsis asteriscoides and Psoralea aphylla. The soil should be mulched but not dug over, as this will disturb the roots.",,,,,,,,
Adenium,Adenium,,"Adenium This is a genus of deciduous succulent shrublets, shrubs or small trees. The smooth, fleshy, swollen stems are sometimes entirely subterranean with only fleshy branches above ground. The plants have tubers or rootstocks and usually clear sap. The striking, showy flowers are carried in few-flowered clusters at the tips of branches and range from white, pink, red to purple and white edged crimson. Leaves are alternate or in simple spirals, often in terminal clusters, and are sessile or have short stalks. The corolla is funnel- or cup-shaped, with a cylindrical tube. The part of the fruit (mericarp) that contains the seeds is long and thin (follicular) and opens by a simple opening. Seeds are light brown, with a deciduous tuft of hairs at each end. Plants are slow-growing, but long-lived and are easily grown from seed or cuttings. The various species flower at different times of the year.","The genus name is derived from the geographical place name Aden in Arabia where the first known plant was found and recorded.

","Distribution The five species of the genus are found in tropical and southern Africa, on Socotra and the Arabian Peninsula. Four species are native to southern Africa ( Namibia, Botswana, Angola, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Malawi, Mozambique and South Africa ).

In nature these species are found in sandy soil in open, sunny positions. Plants are naturally well adapted to the hot and dry environment in which they grow. The succulent stems and tubers act as water stores and enable the plants to survive the harshest conditions. The thick tuberous underground stems help the plants to survive long periods without water. Cold weather induces dormancy during the winter months.

Browsing wild animals have not been observed to be influenced by the poisonous compounds in the plants, but domesticated animals have been reported to die after eating plant parts.

The seeds, aided by their tufts of loose hairs, are dispersed by the wind.

All species have very striking, decorative flowers and make good subjects for rock gardens or containers in warmer climates. They have been horticulturally developed by numerous growers world-wide and many cultivars are available.

",The stem and roots are reported to contain more than 30 cardiac glycosides.,"The attractive flowers of adeniums and their interesting stems make them desirable for the garden. Generally most adeniums are cultivated from seed. Adenium multiflorum and A. obesum are the most well-known and widely cultivated members of the genus. They are slow-growing but long-lived plants and thrive in sandy soils in hot areas. These extremely drought-resistant plants should be planted in well-drained soil and in full sun. They are definitely not suitable for cold, damp gardens as they are very sensitive to frost. In warm gardens that experience occasional frost they should be given a very warm, sheltered position. Adenium boehmianum, A. multiflorum, A. obesum and A. swazicum make good accent plants in a rock garden, especially when grouped together with other caudiciform succulent plants such as species of Pelargonium, Cissus and Cotyledon ; A. boehmianum is rarely cultivated. All species need full sun, lots of water (except during the dormant phase) and must have good drainage. Plants are leafless for most of the year. It is said to be difficult to transplant mature plants owing to the large tuberous rootstocks. Adenium swazicum is an ideal subject for container cultivation.

Propagation from seed: Fruits of these plants are produced as pairs of horn-like pods. To prevent the fruits from splitting when mature and releasing their seeds, they should be taped up with strips of masking tape or cotton yarn when they turn pale brown. Sow the seeds in a 5-7 mm deep sandy medium (4 parts fine and 4 parts coarse river sand; 1 part sieved, well-rotted compost; 1 part perlite; 1 part vermiculite). Water (not too much) and a temperature of 27-35°C will ensure that the seeds germinate rapidly.

Stem cuttings: A denium multiflorum, A. oleifolium and A. swazicum are easily propagated from stem cuttings. Take 100-220 mm long cuttings in late spring, seal the ends or dip them in a rot-preventing mixture. They can also be dusted with a hormone powder and then left to dry out for about a week. Plant the cuttings in the same mixture as the seeds, but start watering only after root development is noticed.

Grafting: Grafts of Adenium multiflorum on Nerium oleander roots are well documented and are widely marketed as container plants in Europe. Such grafted plants can be watered more frequently without fear of rotting of the roots.",,,"The sap of Adenium boehmianum is very bitter and it is the only species used by the Heikom Bushmen of Namibia to poison their arrows for hunting game. The poison is extracted in winter after the plants have flowered. The tuber is dug up and the sap extracted through pressure or by heating the thicker branches and roots over a fire until the sap exudes. It is boiled to condense it to a light brown, thick syrup, cooled and applied to the arrow point just behind the tip. The latex is usually the sole ingredient in this arrow poison. The concentrated latex has been reported to be an item of trade. Large antelope usually die within 100 m from where they have been shot while springbok usually succumb within an hour. The latex of various Euphorbia species is sometimes added to make the poison even more potent. The common name ouzuwo is the Herero word for poison. Adenium multiflorum is used as a fish, arrow and magical poison in Mozambique and South Africa. Poison is prepared from the bark and fleshy parts of the trunk, but always in combination with poisons from other plants. Pounded fleshy leaves of Adenium oleifolium are used by the San to make an ointment for relief of snakebites and scorpion stings. A tea made from the root is used as a tonic and for treating fever. The sap is used as an arrow poison in southern Namibia.",,,,,
Mimusops zeyheri,Mimusops zeyheri,sweetly scented ,"reach up to 15 m under ideal conditions. It is, however, often encountered as a shrub or small tree in its natural range and only reaches its full potential in protected valleys and forest margins where moisture is more available.

The leaves are glossy, dark green and carried on a spreading crown, which could easily be as wide as the tree is high. It has the potential to make an excellent evergreen garden specimen for larger gardens, parks and golf courses. This tree casts a deep shade, which offers a cool escape from the hot African sun. It is possibly overlooked as a horticultural subject due to the erroneous perception that it can be somewhat slow growing and consequently takes many years to reach its full potential.

Small, white, sweetly scented flowers are borne in October to February. Fruits are oval with a pointed tip ripening yellow or orange from April to September.","The botanical name is derived from the Greek mimo meaning ape, and ops meaning resembling an ape. Some authors have speculated that this may be in reference to the colour of the flowers or the shape of the corolla. (Schmidt et al. 2002). The specific epithet honours C.L.P. Zeyher (1799-1858), a German botanist and collector of plants particularly in southern Africa.","This tree occurs across a wide range including the four northern provinces of South Africa as well as Kwa-Zulu Natal, Swaziland and Mozambique. It also extends northwards into Zimbabwe and tropical Africa. It occurs naturally on rocky outcrops, wooded hillsides, riverine and forest fringes as well as in open, dry woodland and bushveld. The wide range of natural occurrence suggests that it would be ideally suited to cultivation in summer rainfall areas of meduim to lower altitude areas where frost is minimal or absent. Experience at the Walter Sisulu National Botanical Garden indicates that it is tolerant only of a moderate degree of frost. The milkwoods are represented by four species in South Africa. The genus Mimusops is a member of a large family of mainly tree species predominantly from tropical climates. ",,"The Transvaal red milkwood is easily cultivated and best utilized in larger gardens and open spaces. They may be used as individual specimen trees or groupings of several specimens where space permits. It is the ideal tree under which to create an entertainment area due to its wide canopy and dense shade created by the evergreen leaves. However, while the tree is in fruit it may not be ideally suited for this purpose as the birds and other animals may create a mess under the tree. It is well suited to cultivation in the medium to lower altitude regions of the summer rainfall areas of southern Africa and in protected valleys of the highveld areas. It is a popular bonsai subject and may also be attractive as an indoor plant, it is said to have a root system which is safe for planting near swimming pools, buildings and paving (Venter & Venter 1996).

The seed should be extracted from the fleshy fruit and sown fresh for best results. Seed have a high viability and germination begins within two weeks of sowing. The seedlings may be left in the seedling trays until the following spring or pricked out at the two-leaf stage into individual containers.

Growth rate of seedlings is fast and saplings of a metre or more can be obtained within three to four years of sowing. Rapid development under nursery conditions can be promoted by the use of balanced horticultural fertilizers. During this time the plants should be promoted to progressively larger containers to prevent root bounding.

Saplings are usually ready to be planted out after four or more years from sowing, at which time attention should be given to the planting hole. Mix good compost with the back filling soil and add bone meal or tree planting tablets to the bottom of the hole. Saplings can be watered well for the first year, gradually reducing irrigation over the ensuing two to three years to ensure the development of a deep root system.

In higher lying areas young trees should be protected against frost for the first three years while the tree becomes acclimatized and attains some height to offer more resistance to mild or moderate frost; this species will not survive any extreme degree of frost.

Mimusops zeyherii is not prone to disease, but may attract scale insects on the young stems and growth tips, which should be monitored on smaller specimens to ensure the damage is not unsustainable. If it becomes necessary, they may be sprayed with a product registered for use on scale. Mineral oil can be effective and is harmless to the ladybird beetles and spiders as well as the environment, in extremely stubborn cases mineral oil can be alternated with products containing chlorpyrifos at 750g/kg.

The trees may attract caterpillars at certain times of the year which should be left alone as they will pupate into beautiful butterflies and the damage they do to the tree will quickly be replaced with new growth. If such damage occurs on young saplings, caterpillars can be removed by hand or by using a strong spray of water.",,,,,,,,
Dune Poison-Bush,Acokanthera oblongifolia,sweetly scented ,"Evergreen to semi-deciduous shrub or small tree, 2–7 m, sometimes up to 15 m tall, with randomly sized stems of about 230 mm in diameter, with dark brown to greyish, rough bark and erect branches.

Drosera aliciae,Drosera aliciae,,"Drosera aliciae is a perennial carnivorous plant with a few, fairly thin, long roots. Wedge- to spoon-shaped leaves, up to 25 mm long and 7 mm wide, are tightly packed to form a dense, clumping basal rosette, 15-400 mm high. Leaves are often reddish and similar in size and are covered with reddish, sticky, glandular hairs.

Older dead leaves are retained below, thus creating a mound. Petioles (leaf stalks) are absent but oval stipules up to 5 mm long and with three indentations are present on either side of the base of the lamina margin. The central lobe of the stipules is lance-shaped while the outer lobes are narrow, elongated bristles. Both marginal and discal (on the upper surface) tentacles are present. The lower surface of the lamina has a fine layer of short, dense hairs that lie flat.

The flowering stalk extends horizontally from the rosette before curving to become erect, giving rise to the common name, shepherd's crook. The single, stiff-stemmed inflorescence can reach up to 400 mm long and usually bears 2-12 simple, purple flowers which mature in ascending order. The three free styles are spoon-shaped at the top. Flowers appear from December to January.

Blackish-brown seeds are tapered on either end with a thick hard outer coating on both sides. The seed capsule is oval.","Drosera gets its name from the Greek word, droseros, meaning dewy. The species was first named and published in the Journal de Botanique in 1905 by Raymond-Hamet (1890-1972) who was 15 years old at the time. He named Drosera aliciae in honour of Dr. Alice Rasse who encouraged him to study the sundew family. Drosera aliciae is closely related to D. natalensis and they can become difficult to distinguish in the Eastern Cape where their distributions overlap. D. aliciae is a more compact plant and the stipules are divided in three while D. natalensis has more irregularly fringed stipules and a more lax habit.

Some of the other commonly known species within this family are the prolific D. trineriva, the tufted D. pauciflora and the largest of the South African species, D. regia.","Drosera aliciae is endemic to South Africa and is a common species in the Western Cape, its distribution extending into the Eastern Cape. It occurs at altitudes from 30 to 2000 m.

This marsh plant is usually found in damp, peaty, exposed areas on stream and river banks or in seeps.

The genus Drosera was named by Linnaeus in 1753 and consists of ± 126 species of which 23 occur in South Africa. Flowers open very briefly for a few hours with good sunlight. They can be pollinated by insects but are usually self-pollinated. When the seeds are ripe, their capsules open to release fine, lightweight seeds which fall out and are dispersed near the parent plants. Probably the most interesting characteristic of this plant is its ability to digest nutrients, especially the nitrogen it requires, from insects caught in its stalked tentacles. Different types of glandular growths include marginal tentacles situated near the lamina margins, discal tentacles which are shorter and disc-like on the upper leaf surfaces, digestive glands filled with red fluid and glandular hair-like growths on the inflorescence. ","he stalks end in a bulbous head in which the glandular cells occur. These glands secrete a glistening, sticky, clear fluid used to trap and retain prey. There is speculation that the fluid is slightly sweetly scented to attract insects. The fluid contains a weak acid and enzymes that digest the soft parts of the prey. ","Droseras make fascinating house and conservatory plants around the world but are better suited to being grown outdoors. Keep them under roof if you wish to retain their vivid red colouration. Plants can also be brought indoors for short periods for display. Drosera aliciae is a hardy, long-lived carnivorous plant, but not necessarily the easiest for novices.

Drosera species have also been recorded for use against various ailments. Extracts of the leaves were used externally for warts, corns and sunburn. Disorders such as tuberculosis, asthma, coughs, eye and ear infection, liver pain, morning sickness, stomach conditions, syphilis, toothache and intestinal problems were treated internally with teas or extracts made from the leaves. The tea was also used as a tranquilizer, and some believe that it has aphrodisiac properties. Antispasmodic agents have been found by scientists in some Drosera species.

Drosera aliciae grows best in 1 part sand or silica grit: 1 peat or sphagnum moss in 9-15 cm pots. It is important not to over-pot plants. Taller rather than wider pots are ideal for Drosera to thrive. Pot plants up according to their size and the depth needed for their long, although few, roots. Place the potted plants in a 10-30 mm deep saucer filled with fresh water to keep them moist at all times. Allow the saucer to dry out occasionally so that the medium can aerate. This will not harm your plants as long as the moisture content in the medium is still high. Place in a northern or eastern situation for best sunlight if growing indoors. Grow in full sun to semi-shade outdoors.

Sundews are easily propagated by seed. Prepare a 90 mm pot with growth medium and water well. In autumn sow fresh seeds on the surface in moist growth medium. Do not cover with growth medium. Place in a semi-shady position. Seeds should germinate in 2-4 weeks.

For vegetative propagation partially cover healthy living root or leaf cuttings with growth medium. Place in a well-lit area but not in direct sunlight. Cover pots with plastic to retain humidity. Once young leaves develop, pierce the plastic to allow for acclimatization and hardening off. Acidic or epiphytic foliar feed may be used once a month at ¼ recommended strength.

Ironically, the carnivorous plants are attacked by insect pests. Aphids, mealy bug and thrips cause deformity in new growth. Treat with a diluted pesticide or remove pests by hand. Never use a soap-based insecticide. Drying out can cause drooping and the decrease in mucilage production. Watering and keeping the plant moist will revive them. Dew production may stop after transplanting or if the leaf comes into contact with inquisitive hands. New foliage will, however, grow and continue to produce dew. Mature plants die off from time to time, but usually young shoots develop off their rhizomatous stems or roots, so wait a few weeks before you throw them out!",,,,,,,,
Asparagus aethiopicus,Asparagus aethiopicus,,"Asparagus aethiopicus is a branching, perennial climber, 2–3 m high, with firm, woody stems which are armed with short, 10–12 mm long, hard, recurved spines. Young stems are twining and ribbed, becoming woody, smooth and pale. The root system is rhizomatous, with many long roots forming bulbous tubers and a mat of fibrous roots, from which new stems may resprout. The leaves are not true leaves but are actually leaf-like cladodes (modified flattened stem), which are 10–40 mm long and 1.0–1.5 mm wide, and arise in groups of 4–6 from the stem. Cladodes are terete (cylindrical in cross section) or ridged, tipped with a short, sharp point and usually grey-green.

The flowers are small, white, star-like and fragrant, 3–5 mm long and arise in clusters off the stem, mainly in summer to winter (Jan.–Jun.). Flowers are followed by small, rounded berries 5 mm in diameter, which bear a black, 3 mm diameter seed. Initially green, the berries turn red when mature in spring to early summer (Aug.–Nov.).","This species was originally described by Carl Linnaeus in 1767. The genus name is derived from asparagos, the Greek name for the cultivated asparagus. The species name aethiopicus, is Latin and means ‘from Africa’.","Asparagus aethiopicus has been confused with A. densiflorus, as the specimen described by the botanist Eduard von Regel in 1896 as Asparagus sprengeri and made popular as an ornamental plant by Carl Ludwig Sprenger, is in fact A. densiflorus, but it has mistakenly been called a synonym of A. aethiopicus. These 2 species are not similar, Asparagus densiflorus is a small (300–600 mm tall), compact bushy plant with no spines. The true current identity of ‘Sprenger’s Asparagus’ is the cultivar Asparagus densiflorus ‘Sprengeri’.",,"Asparagus aethiopicus is grown as an indoor plant in cold climates, or as an ornamental garden plant in urban gardens, rockeries or in pots and can be trained up a trellis. It thrives in sun or semi-shade. It is drought tolerant and a good pioneer species. It can be propagated by seed sown in spring, summer or autumn, after cleaning off the fleshy covering. Older clumps can also be lifted and divided; be sure to get a piece of the rhizome with a few attached tubers for every new clump. Gardeners growing this plant outside of its natural range should take note of its weedy nature and take care not to let it escape into surrounding natural areas.

Collecting seed from Asparagus aethiopicus

The populations of Asparagus aethiopicus are deteriorating in South Africa because of habitat loss through agriculture and other related human developments. The Millennium Seed Bank Partnership (MSBP) managed by SANBI, has collected and conserved the seed of Asparagus aethiopicus, in 2016. The seed collected is readily available for any required conservation programme, such as habitat restoration or species re-introduction where relevant. The horticulturists can also make use of the seed to conduct research, such as development of germination or viability tests. The species is a wild relative of Asparagus officinalis, the edible asparagus crop plant, and could potentially be used to develop a new variety of asparagus crop that is resistant to harsh conditions, like drought, pests and diseases, to improve food security in the country.

The MSBP team avoided collecting green fruits because they are immature. Collecting immature seed is very destructive to the population, as the seed will ultimately die within a few days of collection. The best time to collect seed from the species is when most of fruits on the plant turn red and the seed turns black, as a sign of ripeness. The fruits become very soft and easy to remove seed from the fleshy part of the fruit. Only 20% of available seed should be collected to avoid damaging the population. Make use of cotton or cloth bags to carry fruits. The fruits are fleshy and seeds must be removed from the fruit by washing immediately after collecting, to avoid moulding and ultimately rotting. The washed seeds must be kept in open trays to allow ventilation. Most of the ripe fruits can be found between August and November in the Eastern Cape Province. Seeds are stored in a long-term storage unit at under -20ºC temperature and 15% relative humidity.","Introduced as an ornamental plant, it has escaped from cultivation, naturalized and is now considered an invasive weed in many countries. In the United States, it has been declared a weed in Hawaii and Florida. It has also been declared a weed in New Zealand, and has become established around major urban areas in Australia, including Sydney, Wollongong, the Central Coast, Southeastern Queensland and Adelaide, as well as Lord Howe and Norfolk Islands. It has also been introduced to Ethiopia, Eritrea, Madagascar, Mauritius, the Marianas and Marshall Islands, Puerto Rico, Argentina and Uruguay. ",,,,,,,
Pelargonium cucullatum,Pelargonium cucullatum,Faintly scented,"When in flower Pelargonium cucullatum is covered with pinkish, purple flowers and is the most conspicuous pelargonium in the south western Cape, especially when growing in dense masses.

Pelargonium cucullatum is a fairly tall, sprawling shrub that grows to a height of more than 2 m. The shrub is branched with the bottom of the main stem becoming quite woody. The leaves are more or less round or kidney-shaped and cupped, sometimes succulent. When crushed the leaves of some forms emit a strong, sweet scent. The leaves are approximately 5-8 cm wide, turned upward, slightly incised and have reddish tips. Both the stems and leaves are hairy.

The flowers come in many shades, ranging from dark to light mauve and pink. Occasionally white forms are also found. The veins on the flowers are streaked purple and are prominent on all five petals. Pelargonium cucullatum flowers profusely for a month or two, any time from September to February. The flowers are faintly scented. Sunbirds, butterflies, long-beaked flies and moths have all been observed visiting the flowers.","The species name comes from the Latin cucullatus meaning ""hood"" and refers to the shape of the cupped leaves. The plant was introduced into cultivation in England by Bentick in 1690.",,,"Pelargoniums are easily grown and fairly adaptable. They can be propagated vegetatively and from seed. Pelargonium cucullatum requires full sun and little attention once it is established.

Vegetative propagation by means of stem cuttings is the method most widely used. Cuttings may be taken in autumn or summer from a parent plant that is strong and healthy. The stem should be fairly firm but not woody. Most of the leaves and stipules should be removed, leaving only a few leaves intact on the top. If the leaves are large they may be trimmed to reduce moisture loss. The cuttings should be left to dry for a few hours before placing into the soil. The cuttings should be rooted in trays filled with a well-drained medium such as coarse river sand, or planted directly into the ground. The basal ends of the cutting should be dipped in a rooting hormone, e.g. Serradix, to improve the rate of rooting, then inserted in a prepared hole made by a dibber or a nail to avoid damaging the ends.

The cuttings should be kept moist, but as this is a fairly drought resistant plant you should avoid over-watering or the cuttings might damp off. Four to eight weeks later, after root formation, cuttings should be fed with a seaweed extract product. One or two weeks after this, the cuttings may be potted. Plants produced this way will flower in approximately 3-6 months.

Pelargoniums can also be grown from seed. The seed of pelargoniums is quite interesting in that, attached to the elliptically shaped seed, is a feathered tail-like structure that is coiled in a spiral. The tail allows the seed to drill and secure itself in the soil if twisted around by the wind or affected by the movement of the animals.

Sow the seed in a light, well-drained soil which contains coarse sand. Firm down gently to level the medium. Broadcast the seeds evenly, covering them with a layer of clean white sand. The depth of sowing is usually 1.5 times the size of the seed. Water thoroughly but gently and provide light shade. Germination usually takes place within 10 -14 days. Pelargoniums grown from seed are generally more vigorous than those made of cuttings; however, they take longer to flower.",,,"Traditionally this pelargonium was used medicinally to cure colic, kidney ailments, diarrhoea, coughs and fevers. The leaves were used as a poultice for bruises, stings and abscesses. In the 19th century it was used as a hedgerow ornamental in Cape Town. It is also useful as a cut flower as the branches last for many weeks in water.",,,,,
"Felicia erigeroides
","Felicia erigeroides
",,"Felicia erigeroides is an evergreen, herbaceous perennial or sprawling shrub. It has a slender, erect growth habit 0.75-1 m high. The leaves, 40 x 8 mm, are usually 3-veined and borne in tufts. The edges of the leaves are fringed with hairs.

The flower heads are borne in terminal clusters at the branch tips. The ray florets range from white, subtle shades of pink, mauve to lilac and the central disc florets are yellow. Each flower is about 10-20 mm wide when fully open and borne singly on short peduncles, 30-40 mm long, from March to July. The ray florets curl backwards and the colour deepens as the flower heads die.

The flower heads turn into fluffy seed heads after flowering. The seeds are small, cream-coloured to light brown with hairs (pappus) attached at the tip.","Felicia is named after Herr Felix, a German official who died in 1846. The genus consists of 85 species of which 79 species are found in southern Africa. The majority are found in the Cape Province. It is also occurs in other parts of southern and tropical Africa to Arabia.","Felicia erigeroides is not listed on the Red Data List.

Felicia erigeroides grows naturally on grassy hillsides, coastal bush and forest margins up to an altitude of 1000 m. It occurs from Humansdorp to KwaZulu-Natal.The genus Felicia ( astertjie ) consists of annuals, herbaceous perennials and small shrubs. Other interesting felicias worth growing in the garden include:

The masses of pink to mauve flowers with bright yellow centres attract small insects, bees and butterflies to the garden. The seeds form fluffy heads which act as parachutes, easily carried away in the wind.",,"Felicia erigeroides is an excellent garden subject and best displayed when planted in groups of 6-9 plants. Use it as a border plant, in a mixed fynbos bed, in front of taller shrubs, in rockery garden pockets or as a filler plant. It is an ideal pot or container plant for the stoep or patio.

In a mixed herbaceous border display this Felicia does well with Arctotis arctotoides (botterblom), Cineraria saxifraga (wild cineraria), Geranium incanum (bergtee), Diascia integerrima (twinspur), Lobelia valida (galjoenblom), Orphium frutescens (sea-rose), Scabiosa incisa, Ursinia abrotanifolia and U. sericea (lace-leaf ursinia), and with taller shrubs such as Acmadenia mundiana, Phylica ericoides, Hemizygia canescens and restios.

Felicia erigeroides, once established in your garden, forms a round bush. It is a good coastal plant, tolerates sand and wind. It grows well in any soil, plant it in the garden in full sun, water well after planting and add a layer of compost for good results. It is quick growing, frost tender and requires light pruning after flowering. This encourages vigour, flowering, removes old flower heads and maintains the shape of the plant. Replace the plant after 2 to 3 years.

Felicia erigeroides is easily propagated from cuttings or seed. New plants are easily produced from cuttings taken from new growth during autumn or spring. Take cuttings 40-60 mm long below a node and remove the lower leaves. Dip the end of the cutting in rooting hormone powder and place it in a rooting medium of 1:1 fine-milled pine bark and polystyrene. Place the cuttings in a mist unit with overhead misters and a bottom heat of 25º C. Cuttings root easily within 2-3 weeks, pot them up and allow them to grow before planting out. Once established in the garden they grow fast.

Sow seed in March or April; germination occurs within two weeks; prick out seedlings and plant in bags or containers. Allow the plants to grow before planting out in the garden.",,,"In Zulu medicinal use, a hot leaf infusion is used as a purgative for intestinal parasites and abdominal pain.

Vachellia tortilis,Vachellia tortilis,,"Vachellia tortilis subsp. tortilis reaches heights of between 5 and 20 m in nature. It is fairly slow-growing and in cultivation reaches a final height of between 3 and 5 m with a spread of 8-13 m. In extremely arid conditions, it may occur as a small, wiry bush.

The bark on the trunk is rough and varies from medium grey to almost black, with somewhat tortuous longitudinal fissures. On main branches the covering is dark and fissured. Branches about 40 mm in diameter are a dark grey with occasional blackened fissures here and there. Branchlets about 10 mm in diameter vary from olive green to brown or purplish. There are some interesting variations in the armature.

The thorns are in pairs at nodes which may be spaced at as little as 5 mm near tips, but up to 10-20 mm further down. Straight and hooked thorn pairs usually alternate at consecutive nodes, but a pair may comprise one hooked and one straight thorn.

There are usually from 2-6 leaves per node. In any such group there may be one or two major leaves, but often all are the same size. The leaf stalk length can be up to 30 mm but is ordinarily only half this dimension or even less. Both petiole (leaf stalk) and rachis (central axis of a compound leaf) are green and pubescent. There is, in most cases, a green or brown, domed or cupped gland on the petiole immediately below the first pinna pair (pinna = primary division of a compound leaf).The rachis is grooved on top, has inconspicuous raised dark glands at 2 or 3 or even more of the distal pinna junctions and ends in a short and rather blunt mucro. Pinna pairs vary, as a rule, from 4-10 in number, the average being 6.

There are up to 4 flower heads per node. They are globose, cream to white, scented and somewhat inconspicuous unless flowering happens to be profuse. The peduncle (stalk of the inflorescence) is about 13-14 mm long, slender, pubescent and has an involucel (a group of bracts) located at approximately one-third of the length up from the base. Flowers usually appear about midsummer but have been observed as late as February. Timing is probably largely dependent on the climate.

The fruits (pods) of this species cannot be confused with those of any other South African Vachellia or Senegalia. They are rolled up into a tight circle or wound into a helix of three or four turns, like a coil spring. The width is about 8 mm and the length of a helically coiled pod of three turns was calculated at 125 mm.They are longitudinally venose (veined), somewhat woody, usually glabrous and dry out to a light khaki colour.They occur in bunches and are indehiscent (not opening when ripe). Pods contain up to 14 seeds, some of which often do not mature. The seeds are well rounded, ellipsoid in outline, with face dimensions about 5,5 x 4 mm, greenish brown with a dark brown horseshoe-shaped areole (a distinct area on the face of a seed).","This tree was previously called Acacia tortilis.

The genus name Vachellia is named a after George Harvey Vachell (1789 – 1839), chaplain to the British East India Company in Macoa, who collected plants in China.The specific name tortilis = twisted, referring to the shape of the pods.","This is a very widely distributed species and occurs in Namibia, Botswana, Limpopo, North-West, Gauteng, Mpumalanga, Swaziland, the Free State, KwaZulu-Natal and Northern Cape, and in other countries north of southern Africa. The plant is known to tolerate high alkalinity, drought, high temperatures, sandy and stony soils, strongly sloped rooting surfaces, and sand blasting. Plants older than 2 years have been observed to be somewhat frost resistant. Vachellia tortilis occurs in deciduous woodland, thornveld and bushveld. It is found from sand dunes and rocky scarps to alluvial valley bottoms, avoiding seasonally waterlogged sites. A very drought-resistant species, the umbrella thorn grows in areas with annual rainfall as low as 40 mm and as much as 1200 mm, with dry seasons of 1-12 months. The tree favours alkaline soils but will colonize saline and gypseous soils. There are four subspecies.",,"Seeds should be immersed in boiling water and soaked until they swell. The testa (seed coat) is thick and impervious and could be nicked or filed before soaking, but that is a tedious operation unless one is only concerned with a small number of seeds. Viability seems to vary considerably, both excellent and poor results having been obtained. Germination often takes place in as little as 4 days, but 10 days is a more likely period. Seedling growth is rather slow and even after planting out, trees often progress tardily. Growth to a height of 0,8 m in four years has been observed. On the other hand, young trees frosted back to ground level in winter have subsequently attained a height of 1 m in one season. Young trees do not appear to be capable of withstanding much frost. It is drought-resistant but watering and applications of fertilizer will appreciably improve the rate of growth.",,,"The pods are eaten by stock and game which disperse the seeds.

The timber is used for fence posts, firewood, furniture and wagon wheels. The prolific pods make good fodder for desert grazers and the foliage is also palatable, Acacia tortilis being one of the major dry season fodder trees of the Sahara-Sahelian belt. Bark is used for string in Tanzania. Gum is used as a poor man's gum arabic, said to be edible. It is the tree most recommended for reclaiming dunes in India and Africa. The thorny branches are used to erect temporary cages and pens. Bark is said to be a good source of tannin. Africans once strung the pods into necklaces. Senegalese use the roots for spear shafts; Lake Chad natives use the stems for fish spears. African nomads often use the flexible roots for frameworks of their temporary shelters. The pods and leaves are highly nutritious. Vervet monkeys and baboons eat young green pods; other animals eat those which have fallen to the ground.",,,,,
Arctotis revoluta,"Arctotis revoluta
",,"Arctotis revoluta is a softly woody, spreading shrub between 0.5–1 m tall. In some areas it grows closer to 2 m. It has a spread of roughly 0.5–1 m.

The leaves are usually bipinnatisect (deeply cut almost to the midrib) with long, narrow segments. The margins are revolute (rolled under) and crispate (curled and twisted irregularly). The leaves are discolorous (display different colour of the upper and lower leaf surfaces), appearing grey-felted below and glabrescent (becoming hairless with age) above.

Large, solitary flower heads are borne on woolly stalks during spring (August to November). The ray florets are yellow to orange above, with the underside maroon. The disc florets are yellow. Fruits are achenes with two cuneate (wedge-shaped) cavities.","This species is found on rocky, granite outcrops and coastal sands from Namaqualand to the Breede River Mouth and inland towards the Worcester-Ceres area. In these areas it is found growing in sandstone fynbos or Cape seashore vegetation.",Along the coast this species seldom grows above 0.5 m as it oftens get battered by relentless winds.,,"Arctotis revoluta can be propagated by cuttings or seed.

Cuttings can be taken at any time of the year, and are currently the most effective way to propgate this plant. Take healthy tip-cuttings, cut it below a node, remove about a third of the lower leaves on the stem, dip in a rooting hormone and place in hole already prepared, in a well-draining medium. The tray of cuttings can be placed in a mist-unit with bottom-heat. Cuttings will be ready in two to three weeks.

Sow seed in autumn in a light, well-drained medium. Cover seed lightly with a thin layer of fine sand. Seed may germinate between 10–14 days, but is at best erratic. Seed can be subjected to a smoke-treatment which slightly improves germination rates. Seeds should ideally be subjected to various other germination pre-treatments in future.

The fast-growing seedlings or rooted cuttings can be fed with organic or inorganic fertilisers. During winter the young plants can be planted straight into gardens with Mediterranean climates.

This is a hardy species which only needs sufficient watering during its establishment phase in a garden. After this, plants should cope rather well. In gardens away from the coast or those which are frost-free; it is worth not planting too close together, as plants will thrive in such conditions. The krulblaar gousblom is a good for problematic sandy or rocky patches. It thrives in many different soil conditions or habitats. It should ideally be replaced between three to four years, before it becomes too woody. Regular removal of spent or dead flower heads, will prolong the flowering season.

Plant it in rockeries, rocky areas, coastal gardens (away from or close to the ocean) or amongst fynbos. Companion plants may include: Pelargonium capitatum and P. fulgidum, Didelta carnosa var. tomentosa, Senecio elegans, Carpobrotus acaniciformis and C. edulis, Felicia filifolia, Protea nitida, Gazania rigens var. leucolaena, Arctotheca populifolia and A. stoechadifolia, Lampranthus amoenus and L. aureus and Cotyledon orbiculata.",,,here are no records of it having any medicinal or cultural uses.,,,,,
Sclerochiton harveyanus,Sclerochiton harveyanus,,"The multi-stemmed rounded spread of this lovely shrub generally reaches 3 x 3 m, occasionally growing to a small tree at 4 m high.

Its branches are soft-wooded, thin and lax, and will occasionally scramble into neighbouring vegetation. Foliage is glossy deep-green above and dull-green on the underside. Small delicate leaves are oval to elliptic, measuring approximately 50 x 25 mm, opposite on 5-mm long stalks. Leaf margins are bluntly and irregularly toothed.

Flowers appear during summer (Dec.-Mar.) and are solitary, borne on stem tips. Flowers are mauve-blue to purple and the lower petals are ribbed, giving the impression of lips, hence the common name `blue lips'. Five fringed lobes, equal in size, short and rounded, are the flowers' distinguishing feature. All Sclerochiton species will produce either white, blue or purple flowers or a combination of the three. After flowering, a green fruiting capsule with a tapering tip emerges.","The genus name is from the Greek skleros = hard and chiton = covering, referring to the woody casing of its fruiting capsule. The species epitjet harveyanus is after Dr William H. Harvey 1811-66 who was Treasurer General of the Cape Colony and author of the early volumes of Flora capensis and later Professor of Botany in Dublin.Sclerochiton was described by Harvey in the London Journal of Botany 1: 27 (1842), however no species were ascribed to that genus at that time. In 1887, Nees referred S. harveyanus to the genus. Today a total of 19 species is recognized.","Sclerochiton harveyanus appears on the 2009 Red List with the status of Least Concern and is under no threat.

Occurs on margins of evergreen forest or as part of the forest understorey from Eastern Cape to Zimbabwe. It can be found at altitudes of 90-1700 m. S. harveyanus is much more widespread than other species of the genus, covering areas such as Limpopo, Mpumalanga, Swaziland, KwaZulu-Natal and Eastern Cape.Like other Acanthaceae genera, Sclerochiton can be identified by opposite leaves and irregular, bisexual flowers with a total of four stamens which can be seen emerging from the corolla.The numerous flowers produced in summer are attractive to pollinating insects which encourage insect-feeding birds into the garden. The wide distribution of S. haveyanus could be attributed to the dispersal of its seed. On ripening, each capsule splits into two valves, explosively ejecting the seed. The fast-rooting nature of new shoots and runners is further explanation of the species' success in the wild. Seeds, which are one of the identifying features of the genus, are without hairs and convoluted.",,"Due to its fast-growing nature, suitability to shady conditions and unusual floral display this species has great horticultural value.

When gardening with Sclerochiton one should bear in mind its natural forest habitat. It is best to grow it in a shaded to semishaded area of the garden. Plant in well-drained soil. Its habitat suggests that the soil should be rich in nutrients, mimicking the thick layer of leaf mould that covers the forest floor; so mulch well with plenty of compost or other organic matter, particularly if outside of a summer rainfall region. Provide a moderate water supply.

S. harveyanus is best positioned under the canopy of other trees, grouped together for best effect. Excellent used as filler in mixed informal beds and as a backdrop planting, or on a shady patio if planted in a container where its floral display can be better appreciated up close, also in that shaded corner of the courtyard or on covered balconies.

Blue lips is best propagated from semi-hardwood cuttings in spring. Place in a well-aerated rooting medium: equal amounts of bark and polystyrene are recommended. The application of rooting hormone is recommended to increase success of rooting. Water consistently, and rooting can be achieved within three weeks. After rooting is established, pot on into a neutral to acid loam medium.

Plants can also be grown from seed. Sow in spring in well-drained soil, mix and cover lightly with the sowing medium. To prevent pre- and post-emergence damping off, the seed should be treated with a fungicide prior to sowing, or watered with a fungicide immediately after sowing. Transplant the seedlings after the first pair of true leaves has emerged, or when they are large enough to handle, into individual bags/pots. Feed generously with a liquid fertiliser and water moderately.

The plant has few pest or disease problems. If kept too wet or planted/positioned incorrectly, mealy bug infestations can occur. Treat them with a suitable recommended pesticide.

To prevent yellowing of leaves and to encourage growth, feed the plant every season with an organic or inorganic fertiliser.

S. harveyanus responds very well to light pruning. Due to the density of its foliage it has great potential to be trained into a small formal hedge or even to be used for topiary.

Relatively unknown in the horticulture industry, this lovely indigenous shrub is sure to become more popular as gardeners discover what a treasure it is.",,,,,,,,
Pachypodium namaquanum,Pachypodium namaquanum,,"Pachypodium namaquanum, the halfmens (half plant, half human), is a succulent plant that can attain a tree-like appearance when fully grown. The stem height may range between 1.5 and 2.5 m, although 4 and 5 m specimens have been observed. The stems are mostly unbranched and cylindrical but may become branched from near the base and occasionally have a few shorter branches near the apex (tip). Plants are characteristically thickset at their bases, tapering toward the apex, which gives them an unmistakable bottle-like appearance when mature. The stems are covered with warty tubercles (knob-like projections), from which spines protrude in a slightly downward direction. The spines are more abundant along the top half of the plant and decrease towards the base where tubercles are more prominent.

The leaves, which are borne in rosettes (cluster of densely spirally arranged leaves arising from a central point), are simple, obovate to oblong, green-grey, and densely velvety on both surfaces. Leaf apexes are tapering or rounded, and the bases narrowly tapering. The leaf margins are entire and very wavy which is another distinctive characteristic of this succulent. Leaves are always formed in crowded rosettes near the stem apex.

The flowers, which appear from July to September, are tubular, up to 50 mm long and 10 mm across at the mouth. They are red on the inside and yellow-green outside.

The fruits are horn-like, with twin pencil-thin tapering capsules of up to 50 mm long that are joined at the base. Short, soft and grey hairs densely cover the fruit. Fruits are pale brown and split to release the wind-dispersed seeds which are about 4 mm long and are attached to a tuft of whitish hairs that act as parachutes. Seeds normally ripen from September to December. Plants are extremely slow growing, around 0.5-1.5 cm per year, and can attain an age of one hundred years or more.","The generic name Pachypodium is derived from the Greek word pachys meaning thick and podion which means foot. The specific name namaquanum refers to Namaqualand, a semi-arid region in the northwestern part of South Africa which is renowned for its spring displays of wild flowers.","Threats to P. namaquanum and associated flora include mining for diamonds and other minerals, overgrazing by sheep and goats in mountainous areas, alien plant invaders (e.g. Prosopis spp.), and illegal removal of succulents by collectors and traders (Van Wyk & Smith 2001).

Pachypodium namaquanum is found in dry rocky deserts at altitudes from 300-900 m above sea level in the Gariep Centre (a centre of floristic endemism), which has the greatest variety of succulents on earth. The climate is harsh and the weather can be quite unpredictable. Rainfall varies from as little as 50 to 150 mm, and occurs mainly in winter. Extreme aridity is experienced in rain shadows of some mountains where as little as 0-15 mm falls annually. Additional precipitation is supplied by thick layers of fog that occasionally move inland from the coast. The maximum temperature in summer may reach 48 °C with a mean of approximately 25 °C.

The plant is associated with the Succulent and Namaqualand Karoo vegetation types which, according to recent floristic status assessments, is one of South Africa's most important regions. Regionally, it is classified as a botanical hotspot in terms of its botanical diversity and the degree of endemism found in the region.

Plants seem to favour rocky and stony hill slopes that are exposed to extreme summer conditions particularly heat and wind. Populations are relatively common in the northwestern mountains of South Africa and the southern mountains of Namibia. Well-known populations are found in the Richterveld National Park which consists of a vast series of rugged mountains and the hot dry Gariep River (Orange River) Valley that divides the lunar-like landscapes of South Africa and Namibia. The areas around Umdaus north of Steinkopf and Rosh Pinah in Namibia are among the places of distribution.

The genus Pachypodium belongs to the Apocynaceae (oleander) family, a well established family in gardens all over the world. There are 23 different species of Pachypodium in the world and 18 of them occur in Madagascar. Pachypodium namaquanum is one of five southern African species. The other members are P. bispinosum (bobejaankos) and P. succulentum (ystervark kambro) from the Karoo, P. saundersiae (kudu lily) from the Lowveld, and P. lealii (bottle tree) from the Kaokoveld in Namibia.

Most members of the Apocynaceae family are found in the tropics where they are usually evergreen trees, shrubs or climbers. In southern Africa, particularly in the warmer drier areas, they are mostly stem succulents or caudiciforms (succulents with swollen stem bases). Popular examples of these plants are Adenium obesum, A. multiflorum (impala lily of the Kruger National Park), A. boehmianum (pylgif) and Fockea edulis (kambro), etc. Another well-known South African plant in this family that is also commonly used in indigenous gardens locally is Carissa macrocarpa (num-num) and C. bispinosa from the Karoo, which bear edible red fruits. Pachypodium namaquanum belongs to the Apocynaceae family, a group of plants with milky or watery sap and generally simple, opposite leaves. It is pollinated by ants and bees which are able to enter the tubular flowers with ease.

Sugarbirds have been observed pollinating cultivated plants in the Karoo Desert National Botanical garden in Worcester, South Africa. Whether the same is true in wild populations is uncertain. After fertilisation, the fruits take two to three months to ripen after which the seeds are dispersed. The seeds are about 4 mm long and are attached to silky hairs which act as parachutes. In the presence of winds, particularly updrafts, the seeds can be blown over vast distances. The parachute seed strategy is also employed by other members of the family, and is an effective way of ensuring healthy, reproductive populations. t is known that desert plants normally limit exposure to solar radiation but P. namaquanum is simply doing the opposite. In response to the lower position of the sun on the horizon during winter and the associated cooler conditions, these plants have adopted a clever method to increase the photosynthetic effect of the sun. This is particularly important as most growth takes place during winter. The stem with its leafy flower heads always inclines towards the north at an angle varying between 20 °C and 30 °C. This tendency, which is shared by some low-growing succulent euphorbias and the Chilean cactus (Copiapo cinerea ), is sometimes explained by the so-called 'magnetic plant' theory. However, it is unlikely that these plants are attracted to the poles by magnetism. A more probable theory is that plants such as P. namaquanum are strongly phototrophic (grow in response to stimuli by sunlight) and grow in places where the sun is in the north for the greater part of the year. They lean northwards to allow maximum exposure to their growing shoots as well as to use the sunlight in the winter to make their flowers more visible to pollinators, thus increasing the plant's chances for seed set. It is a bizarre spectacle indeed when one observes these plants 'looking' towards the north.

As with most plants in the arid Richtersveld and surrounds, survival is of extreme importance. The swollen stem bases act as moisture reservoirs to help the plant cope with extreme drought periods. It does not have succulent leaves to store water, and in fact the leaves shrivel up and fall off in the hot summer months. The tufts of velvety leaves appear again during the brief winter growing period, and act as solar panels that manufacture the energy needed for growth and reproduction.","Whether succulent or shrubby, most members of the Apocynaceae family have milky white sap, and many are known to possess poisonous alkaloids in their tissue.","Unlike some other plants from the Richtersveld and northern Namaqualand, Pachypodium namaquanum does not do at all well away from its natural environment. Although seeds germinate readily, it is not easy to cultivate plants in gardens. They are also not common in cultivation as the plants are protected by conservation law.

Pachypodium namaquanum grows easily from seed as long as the seeds are fresh and without signs of parasitism. The silky-haired parachutes are removed prior to sowing. Seeds can be sown in the summer using a mixture of river sand and sifted compost or bark at a ratio of 1:1. After germination, care should be taken not to overwater as this encourages rot and fungal infestations. Keep plants well ventilated and in good light, and dry plants out in the dormant season which is summer (October to March).

Pachypodium namaquanum can also be grown from cuttings, although success is not guaranteed. Cuttings also take an extremely long time to show active growth. They should be taken in the period just before the growing season starts. The apex (tip of the shoot or leaf) of the stem which contains actively dividing cells is used and the wound is treated with a fungicide or flowers of sulphur and then left to dry for at least two weeks. Cuttings are inserted vertically into a well-drained, sandy medium. The same medium used for germinating seeds can be used for cuttings. Cuttings are kept in a hot, well-lit and ventilated area, and watered sparingly in the winter months; once a week should be more than enough.

Plants in cultivation at the Karoo Desert National Botanic Garden and the Kirstenbosch succulent collection seem to benefit greatly from organically derived fertilisers. Plants in the succulent collection at Kirstenbosch are provided with additional heat by means of heat cables that are buried in the soil. It is inevitable that these plants would require this essential heating in the northern hemisphere countries and be sheltered from the colder wet weather."," this particular plant is listed on CITES as an Appendix 1 and 2 species, which means that its trade is prohibited and the import or export of such plants is subject to the obtainment of certain certificates and permits. It is said that when the spines that arise from the stem are stroked, the plant produces a series of clicking sounds that supposedly mimics the clicks of the Nama language (a population of people found in northwest Namaqualand).

Perhaps the most fascinating story that links these plants to the people of Namaqualand is the legend of the halfmens. It is believed that these trees are half human, half plant, which is easy to understand because, when seen in the distance against the skyline, they could easily be mistaken for humans especially when in family groups. Nama folklore provides a delightful explanation for the tilting of the halfmens. A tribe which once occupied a more forgiving part of southern Namibia was driven southwards after a long and bloody conflict. Eventually its members found themselves fleeing to the Richtersveld, a forsaken mountain desert with a fiercely broken landscape that must have been created by the gods in a moment of rage. Overcome by grief and longing for their homeland, a few among the tribe paused to gaze northward for the last time. The gods took pity on these wretched souls and turned them into half humans or halfmens in order to comfort them with a distant view of their lost homeland for eternity (Cowling & Pierce 1999).",,"the sap of some members such as Pachypodium lealii (bottle tree) and Adenium boehmianum (pylgif) is still used for arrow poison. There are numerous examples of fatalities caused by the extremely potent glycosides and alkaloids found in these plants and, although the family Apocynaceae contains attractive garden subjects, it is best to treat all members of this family as poisonous, or to at least caution their use in horticulture. There are some exceptions such as Carissa macrocarpa which bear highly nutritious edible fruits which are eaten fresh or made into a jam",It is known that P. namaquanum also contains poisonous alkaloids as its sap is also used for arrow poisons. The sap can also cause blindness when in contact with the eyes,,,,
Pelargonium greytonense`,Pelargonium greytonense,,"Pelargonium greytonense is an erect, much branched 1 m shrub 0.75 m in diameter. The stems are soft and green when young but become woody when older. Minute hairs with a few scattered long soft hairs, as well as glandular hairs which are green but become greyish brown when older, are present on the stem.

The palmately (hand-like ) incised leaves are covered with short and rather stiff as well as scattered long hairs. The leaves are aromatic.

Flowers are white to pale pink and are borne in umbel-like inflorescences. This species flowers between September and January with a peak flowering period in October and November.","The Irish botanist William Henry Harvey divided the genus Pelargonium into 15 sections.  Pelargonium gets its name from the resemblance of the fruit to the beak of a stork, which is pelargos in Greek. The specific name greytonense refers to the town of Greyton where the species is found.","Pelargonium greytonense has a small distribution area in the southwestern Western Cape on the southern slopes of the Riviersonderend Mountains. This area receives rain primarily during the winter months and is frost-free because it is relatively close to the coast. High temperatures are experienced during the summer months. Although this species grows only in a small area it occurs locally in large numbers. It is mainly found growing in ravines. The distinctive features of the different sections are mainly leaf and flower characteristics and habitat. Pelargonium greytonense is classified under the section Pelargonium. This section consists of profusely branched often woody shrubs. Their leaves are rarely entire but usually recurrently lobed or divided. The upper two petals are broader and longer than the lower three petals. Seven fertile stamens are present. Other species belonging to this section are P. betulinum, P. capitatum, P. cucculatum and P. papilionaceum. People often refer to pelargoniums as geraniums.

Pelargonium greytonense belongs in the family Geraniaceae, a large cosmopolitan family of approximately 11 genera and 800 species in subtropical and temperate regions of the world. The South African genera in the Geraniaceae family are Monsonia , Sarcocaulon , Pelargonium , Erodium and Geranium . There are approximately 270 species of Pelargonium which occur in S, E and NE Africa, Asia, St Helena, Tristan da Cunha, Madagascar, Australia and New Zealand, but mostly (± 219 species) in southern Africa. The seed is adapted to wind dispersal; it is light in weight and has a feathered, spiral tail. When the seed lands and there is sufficient moisture in the soil, the tail becomes like a drill, twisting the seed into the soil so that the seed can anchor itself in the ground and prevent itself from being blown away, or carried away by moving animals. This ensures that most of the seeds produced, five seeds per flower, have a good chance of germinating.",,"Pelargoniums are easily grown, fairly adaptable plants and are most rewarding in any garden. Pelargonium cultivars have been gracing the balconies of buildings and gardens in the northern hemisphere for many years and have been rated as excellent garden plants.

Pelargonium greytonense, like most other members of the genus, is easily grown from either seeds or cuttings. Cuttings are propagated at any time of the year but best after flowering and seeding. Take semi-mature stem cuttings 150 mm long and apply a rooting powder to stimulate rooting. Place the cuttings into a propagation tray with individual cavities. The cuttings are then placed in a cold-frame or a cool well lit area to root. The cuttings will root within 3 weeks. Once the cuttings have rooted, pot into a well-drained potting soil. The soil medium is made up of equal parts compost, coarse riversand and loam. Young plants can be fed on a monthly basis with an organic-based liquid or granular fertilizer.

This Pelargonium is a winter-rainfall species. Seeds are sown in autumn. Sow the seeds in a light, well-drained potting soil mixture. Broadcast the seeds evenly in the seed tray and cover them with a layer of clean white sand or fine-milled pine bark. The depth of sowing is usually one-and-a-half times the size of the seed. Water thoroughly but gently and provide light shade. Germination usually takes place within 4 weeks. Seeds are best sown when fresh although they may remain viable for up to seven years. Pelargoniums grown from seed are generally more vigorous than those derived from cuttings. They do, however, tend to take longer to produce flowers. Plants grown from seed will show some degree of variation, and if a particular form or variant is required it must be propagated by cuttings.",,,,,,,,
Agathosma crenulata,Agathosma crenulata, aromatic leaves,"This evergreen shrub with aromatic leaves is used medicinally. It forms a charming garden shrub with a rounded shape and grows to a height of 1.5 to 2.5 m. Starry white flowers, 1 to 3, are carried on short, leafless branchlets which form in the axils of the oval leaves. Flowers are 5-petalled, white or occasionally flushed pink. They decorate the shrub for 6-8 weeks between June and November. New shoots have distinctive red-flushed stems.

The shiny, oval green leaves are twice as long (15-35 mm) as they are broad. The leaves are opposite, have serrated edges and scattered oil glands on their undersides. Flowers are followed by green fruit, which darken as they ripen. Agathosma betulina is commonly referred to as the round-leaf buchu, rondeblaarboegoe (Afr.) It is a fragrant shrub growing to a height of 2 m. The leaves are rounded, about 20 mm long with a rounded apex curving backwards; they are rounder than the oval, more linear leaves of A. crenulata. Oil glands are prominent along the margins of the leaves. The flowers are star-shaped, white to pale pink in colour and flowers bloom from June to November. It is easily grown from seed.

Agathosma betulina has a restricted natural distribution area in the Western Cape. It is found on mountain slopes near Niewoudtville, Piketberg and Tulbagh and in the Cederberg Mountains. 

","Agathosma derived from the Greek meaning agathos, pleasant and osme, smell. Agathosma crenulata and A. betulina (see below) belong to the Rutaceae, commonly known as the citrus family. There are 150 species in the genus Agathosma and they are mainly found in the Western Cape. Barosma is an old name for Agathosma.","According to the Red List of South African Plants, Agathosma crenulata is assessed as declining. It has been heavily impacted by harvesting for essential oils throughout its range, and while a reduction in the number of wild plants in some populations has been reported, its estimated decline is not more than 20%, so it is not regarded as threatened. Legislation has also been put in place to manage the trade with the result that wild populations are no longer being harvested

Agathosma crenulata occurs on damp lower slopes of the mountains of southwestern Cape from Tulbagh to Riversdale. In nature it prefers the middle slopes, particularly on siltier valley or shaly soils and often near water. Natural distribution is Mountain Fynbos. The entire shrub is covered in flowers attracting bees and butterflies. Fruit are formed after pollination of the flower. Seed are borne in a 5-chambered capsule, one seed per chamber. The seeds are ready to be harvested when the capsule turns darker in colour, feels harder and the bottom of the capsule is reddish brown in colour. The seeds are dispersed from the capsule upon ripening. This is known as ballistic dispersal. If intending to collect seed for propagation, it is important to inspect the seed capsules daily during the ripening period. To harvest seed, wait for a few capsules to open and collect the darker, plump capsules. Seed ripens towards the middle of summer, is usually during November to December. Seeds collected from fully ripe capsules show a higher germination percentage. If seeds are picked too early, the embryo will not ripen and the seeds will not be viable.","Isomenthone and disphenol are the major oil compounds in the essential oils of A. betulina. The essential oils are used for their antiseptic and diuretic properties. Used in the food industry, the sulphur-containing compounds are responsible for the characteristic blackcurrant smell and flavour of buchu oil. A. crenulata is less desirable owing to high levels of pulegone, a compound considered to be toxic.","Agathosma crenulata can be used as an accent plant in your garden or as a filler plant in a mixed fynbos bed with companion plants such as Protea, Restio, Pelargonium and buchu. It can also be used as a container plant placed in a sunny spot on your stoep or patio.

Planted in your garden this species requires full sun, soil that is acid, well drained and composted. Plant out in groups of 3 to 5 with enough space to grow. Add a layer of mulch to keep the soil and roots cool in summer, retain soil moisture and reduce weeds. Buchus are best planted out during the winter -spring season. Plants require good watering in winter and moderate watering in summer. Do not allow plants to dry out. Once established in your garden they will survive long periods of drought and will withstand a fair amount of frost.

Agathosma crenulata is easily grown from seed. Propagating vegetatively from cuttings takes a bit longer and is difficult. The formation of calluses responsible for the development of roots is slow and cuttings tend to drop their foliage.

Fresh seed is collected when ripe and stored for sowing in autumn. Seed is cleaned and sown on a prepared medium of sand and compost in equal parts in a seed tray. Cover seed with a thin layer of bark and water. Place seed trays in a covered area with good light and ventilation. Keep seed trays damp and germination will take place within 1 to 2 months. Seedlings are pricked out when 4 true leaves have developed. The growing tips of seedlings are pinched out to encourage bushy growth. Feed buchus regularly with a balanced nutrient. The yellowing of leaves can be treated with an application of iron chelate.

Cuttings have the advantage of producing a larger flowering plant quicker than seedlings. Tip cuttings, 50-70 mm, are taken from the current year's growth. Prepare cuttings by making a clean cut below the node and remove the third of the foliage. Dip the base of the cutting in a rooting hormone. Firmly place the cuttings in a medium of 50% bark and 50 % polystyrene. Ideally these cuttings should now be placed in an well-aerated propagation unit with a bottom heat of 24º C. Ideally rooting occurs in 9 to 11 weeks. Carefully pot the rooted cuttings using a well-drained, humus-rich, fynbos potting medium (2 parts leaf mould, 1 part coarse sand). Plants will be ready for planting in 7 to 8 months. Feed regularly with a well-balanced nutrient.",,,"Buchu is part of cultural heritage of the Khoi and San people who used the dried and powered leaves mixed with sheep fat to anoint bodies. Leaves were also chewed to relieve stomach complaints.

Buchu leaves steeped in vinegar, boegoeasyn or brandy, boegoebrandewyn, were an essential part of the medicine chest of the early Cape colonist. They used it for a variety of ailments to treat stomach complaints, worms, indigestion, kidney and bladder ailments. Buchu vinegar was also used to wash and clean wounds. For a relaxing in the bath, tie a bunch of buchu leaves in some old pantyhose and drop it under a hot tap as you fill your bath. It helps to ease backache and rheumatism. Buchu is helpful when drunk as a tea, for urinary tract infection and mild digestive disturbances. It is also said to be an effective treatment for gout and rheumatism when taken daily. Prepare the tea by pouring a cup of boiling water over one or two teaspoons of dried or fresh leaves. Let it stand for 5-10 minutes then strain and drink.

The best known method to use buchu is in the famous buchu brandy. Buchu brandy or vinegar is made by steeping a few thumb-length sprigs of fresh buchu in a bottle of brandy or white vinegar (optional add a few garlic cloves to the vinegar). Shake the liquid daily for a week and store in a cupboard.Agathosma crenulata and A. betulina are commercially grown for their oil. The oil is extracted and used in the manufacture of cosmetics, soaps, food colorants and medicinally for the treatment of renal disorders and chest complaints.",,,,,
Erythrina caffra,Erythrina caffra,,"Erythrina caffra is a medium- to large-sized deciduous tree, 9-12 x 7-11 m. Its size depends largely on the climate and soil conditions. This species forms a round-headed, spreading canopy and has a beautifully light green appearance when in leaf. Trees may even reach a height of 20 m in coastal and forested regions where the conditions are optimal. Some of the largest and most beautiful specimens grow in the Addo National Park's Alexandria Forest where, next to the yellowwoods, they are the tallest trees. The trunk and branches are grey, sometimes set with short, sharp prickles.

As with all other erythrinas, the leaves are typically trifoliate (three leaflets), which are broadly ovate (egg-shaped) to elliptic (oval and narrowed to rounded ends, widest at or about the middle), the terminal leaflet being the largest, 80-160 x 80-180 mm. The lateral leaves are slightly smaller and without hairs or prickles. The leaflet petiole (leaflet stalk) is up to 160 mm long and with or without prickles. The leaves closely resemble those of a sister species, E. lysistemon (sacred coral tree), which is why it was for many years thought to be the same species. When not in flower it can be rather difficult to tell the two species apart.

The flowers are spectacular and are produced before the leaves appear. They are carried in large clusters at the ends of thick, fleshy stalks. Superficially they are shaped like cockscombs. Flowering starts from winter and carries on throughout spring. The flower has a short, broad, standard petal, the lower half of which curves upward to expose the stamens, which give the flower a bewhiskered appearance. When compared to the flowers of E. lysistemon, the latter has longer, narrower standard petals which fold to enclose the stamens. There is also a difference in colour between E. lysistemon and E. caffra. E. caffra has mainly orange-scarlet flowers with a tinge of terracotta, in contrast to the clear scarlet of the northern species. There are also forms of E. caffra which bear cream-coloured flowers occasionally seen in habitat.

The fruits are dark, cylindrical pods, which are up to 65 mm long. The pods split to release the small, shiny, coral-red seeds, which are marked on one side with black spots. As seeds weather and become older, they turn a rich red-brown.","The generic name Erythrina originates from the Greek word erythros which means red and alludes to the bright red flowers and seeds. Caffra is derived from the Arabic word for an unbeliever, kafir, and the southeastern part of South Africa that is now the Eastern Cape was long ago known as Kaffraria, 'the land of the unbelievers'. Today the word is not used as it is an offensive slur. It was used in older botanical works, and generally indicates that the plant was found along the southeastern seaboard of South Africa. Carl Thunberg, who is also known as the father of South African botany, gave the names in 1770.","Erythrina caffra occurs in coastal sheltered forests and along wooded rivers. It recruits very quickly from seeds, which birds carry across large distances. Although an important and well-used tree in rural areas, the coast coral tree is not endangered. Its ease of cultivation makes it readily available for garden use throughout the country.

Erythrina caffra is a subtropical tree that occurs in the warm and frost-free to light frost coastal regions of the Eastern Cape and northern KwaZulu-Natal. The trees are found in various soil types from wet, well-drained, humus-rich soils to dry, clayey soils. The distribution is from the Humansdorp district to Port Shepstone and inland to about 57 km into the Albany district of the Eastern Cape. Further north it is found in the Hlabisa and Lake Sibayi areas of Zululand where it is over 400 km away from its southern populations. This is quite a surprising distribution range. The genus Erythrina is a group of shrubs and trees which have their origin not only in South Africa, but also the West Indies, Brazil, and Australia. The genus contains just over 170 species, six of which are found naturally in South Africa. These are Erythrina caffra, E. lysistemon, E. latissima, E. humeana, E. acanthocarpa and E. zeyheri. The latter two are small to medium shrubs with thick, fleshy, underground stems and are more suitable as grouped plants or container plants in the garden. Three other species are found in southern Africa: E. decora, which is a small- to medium-sized tree that occurs in the central and northwestern region of Namibia, commonly known as the Kaokoveld; E. livingstoniana, which is also a medium to large tree but is found in Zimbabwe and Mozambique; and E. mendesii, which is a small shrub arising from an underground, branched stem and is found in the Kalahari sand in Botswana. Both birds and flying insects pollinate coast coral trees. The flowers of Erythrina caffra do not produce any fragrance, so it is only their colour, in combination with the reward of nectar which is produced in abundance, which attracts pollinators. Birds such as Red-winged Starlings (Onychocnathus morio), Bulbuls (Pycnonotus sp.), Eastern Golden Weavers (Ploceus subaureus), Sunbirds (Nectarinia sp.), Orioles (Orioles sp.), and many others feed on the nectar and red blossoms and can be seen by the hundreds visiting these trees in the early spring. The flowers appear before the leaves, and this may well be a strategy for visible advertising to attract as many nectar-feeding birds as possible. The shape and design of each flower are such that the stamens are exposed, resulting in easy pollen transfer by birds and insects. It is estimated that each flower may hold as many as 7-10 drops of nectar, and each flowerhead may hold up to 80 florets.

The red seeds are also an important food source for many seed-eating birds. Birds therefore not only pollinate the flowers but also aid in seed dispersal, which ultimately impacts on the natural distribution of the species throughout its entire habitat range. The seeds are also fed on by developing larvae of many winged beetles, which lay their small yellow eggs inside the immature pods. Borers also sometimes attack trees and do considerable damage, particularly to young trees. The dead wood of the coast coral tree is soft and is an ideal nesting place for birds such as the Pied Barbet (Tricholaema leucomelas) and Cardinal Woodpecker (Dendropicos fuscescens), while the hollow trunks are often inhabited by swarms of bees.

The branches are armed with prickles, which might serve as protection to herbivores especially when trees are still young. Fully grown trees are fairly drought resistant and can withstand several degrees of frost. In areas where there is severe frost, it may well grow but flowering is unlikely.","Erythrina alkaloids are known to be highly toxic, but the traditional uses strongly suggest antibacterial, anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects.","As with all erythrinas, the coast coral tree is easily cultivated. Sow the bright red seeds in October or November. It is advisable to do a float test first to ascertain which seeds are viable. Sometimes seeds are parasitised by the larvae of beetles and other insects. Simply soak seeds in water, leave overnight and select only those that have sunk to the bottom. The water also helps to soften the hard seed coat so that germination takes place more easily. Another method used to aid germination is abrading, which involves the use of sandpaper or rough emery paper to remove part of the seed coat. Nicking is a modification of abrading and is done by simply removing a small section of the seed coat with a sharp knife. The end on the opposite side of the eye (the black spot on the seed) is removed to provide an opening for water to enter. The germination medium can be drenched with a long-acting pre-emergence fungicide such as Apron. This will help to prevent seed decay and seed-borne diseases, such as damping off, root rot and downy mildew on young seedlings. Pre-emergence fungicides are more commonly used to treat seeds that take a long time to germinate, and in the case of Erythrina caffra this is more the exception than the rule. After germination, seedlings normally grow fast and might then contract fungal diseases. These should then be treated with systemic fungicides such as Fongarid. Poor drainage and over-watering enhance root rot problems caused by soil-borne fungal pathogens. It is also a good idea to drench the germination medium with boiling water before sowing. Use a well-drained medium consisting of 2 parts coarse, washed river sand and one part milled pine bark. Space seeds about 2-3 cm apart and do not cover too deeply; to about 0.3 cm is sufficient. Water well and store in a well-ventilated, sheltered area away from direct sunlight. Water seeds daily using a fine mist spray. Do not water late in the afternoon or early evening, as these are ideal times for fungus to develop.

Another effective and more instant propagation method is by making giant hardwood cuttings called truncheons. These are branches measuring at least 40 mm in diameter. This method works very well and cuttings must be taken just before the trees come out of dormancy which is late winter or early spring. After taking the cutting, allow the wound to dry for 1-2 days. Then bury one-third of the truncheon in soil while leaving two-thirds exposed to produce the new growth. Smaller cuttings root just as well. Again the same medium can be used as for germinating the seeds. Keep the bags or containers moist and store in a shaded place.

Erythrina caffra should be planted in sunny places in well-drained soil. It can tolerate quite moist soils as it often grows on the banks of rivers and streams. The trees will also put up with dry conditions and poor soils; however, they do not respond well to excessively cold conditions. They can also be used in large rock gardens where the smaller species of coral trees e.g., Erythrina zeyeri (plough breaker), E. acanthocarpa (tambookei thorn), and E. humeana can be grown. The trees also provide ideal filtered shade for a host of herbaceous and perennial shrubs. Masses of Plectranthus eckloni, P. ciliatus, P. fruticosus can be planted in combination with purple and white Hypoestes aristata and Dissotis princeps. Other larger shrubs that can be planted with coast coral trees are Mackaya bella, Ochna serrulata, O. natalitia, Burchellia bubalina, Tetradenia riparia and Strelitzia reginae. To obtain multiple colours using bulbs underneath these spectacular trees, various options with different flowering periods are available. Good bulbous plants for mass planting include Scadoxus multiflorus subsp. Katharinae, which has orange flowers in autumn, Crinum moorei, with large, white pink bell-shaped flowers in autumn, Clivia miniata, with its brilliant orange flowers in spring, Dietes bicolor with bicoloured yellow and black flowers in summer, Crocosmia aurea with bright orange flowers in autumn, and Kniphofia praecox and K. uvaria which have beautifully contrasting yellow and orange flowers that appear in summer.","In South Africa, Erythrina caffra is seen as a royal tree: it is a much respected and admired tree in the Zulu culture and is believed to have magic properties. Specimens have been planted on the graves of many Zulu chiefs. In parts of the Eastern Cape, local inhabitants will not burn the wood of Erythrina caffra for fear of attracting lightning.",,"Coast coral trees were also planted as living palisades around the houses of the early settlers, and used as fences around kraals and waterholes. In the Peddie District of the Eastern Cape there are a number of these living fences that have been closely planted around waterholes to keep livestock from the water or to channel them to the entrance.

The wood is very soft, spongy and light. Hollowed trunks were used to make canoes and troughs, and cubes of wood were used as floats for fishnets. When tarred, the wood made good roofing shingles. The African women of South Africa make the highly decorative seeds of Erythrina caffra into necklaces. Children also love collecting them where they are known as lucky beans. All coral trees produce a poison with a curare-like and paralysing action, which is used medicinally to relax the muscles in treating nervous diseases. The seeds of all erythrinas are said to be poisonous, and the leaves of Erythrina caffra are known to have poisoned cattle. The bark of E. caffra is used topically to treat sores, wounds, abscesses and arthritis. Open wounds may be treated with powdered, burnt bark; infusions of the leaves are used as eardrops for earache; and decoctions of the roots are used for sprains. The Vhavenda use the bark for toothache.",,,,,
Babiana villosa,Babiana villosa,"strongly fragrant, such as the sweetly scented B. ambigua, B. nana and B. odorata , and the strongly clove-scented B. fragrans.","This winter-growing, summer-dormant plant grows to 20 cm high. It has a deep-seated corm surrounded by several layers of fibrous outer tunics extended into a prominent neck. Its 5-6 lance-shaped, heavily pleated leaves are covered in short soft hairs and are arranged in a narrow or wide fan.

The flower stem has a dense covering of hairs and has one or two branches. The flowers have very narrow perianth tubes and are actinomorphic (divisible into equal halves in any plane), and the tepals vary in shades of light to deep red or pink and have prominent large black or deep purple anthers. Flowering takes place from late August to late September and the flowers only open fully on hot, still days.

The ripe fruit is a dry capsule which splits longitudinally, allowing dispersal of the numerous dark brown, irregularly angled seeds.","The genus name Babiana is derived from the Dutch baviaantje , meaning little baboon. The name alludes to observations made by early colonists at the Cape who noticed that the local Chacma baboons, the world's most southerly-occurring primates, were very partial to their corms. The British botanist J.B. Ker Gawler formally established the genus Babiana when he described B. plicata Ker Gawl. (now B. fragrans ), the type species, in Curtis's Botanical Magazine in 1802. Babiana villosa was described posthumously by the Swedish naturalist Daniel Solander (1733-1782) as Ixia villosa in William Aiton's Hortus Kewensis, published in 1789. The specific name villosa is descriptive of the short soft hairs which clothe the leaf surfaces. Ker Gawler later transferred the species to Babiana in Curtis's Botanical Magazine in 1802.","Babiana villosa is endemic to the Fynbos Biome and occurs on flats, hills and lower mountain slopes from Malmesbury to Tulbagh, Wolseley and Wellington in the southwestern Cape. It has become rare at Malmesbury and is now most commonly found around Tulbagh and Wolseley in the Upper Breede River Valley. It grows in fertile, stony clay soils in Breede Shale Renosterveld vegetation, often in association with other spring-flowering geophytes including the red-flowered Geissorhiza erosa, the pink ground orchid Satyrium erectum and blue-flowered forms of Lachenalia unifolia.

The genus Babiana contains about 90 species and its centres of diversity are in Namaqualand and the southwestern Cape. These mainly spring-flowering, low-growing plants are confined to southern Africa, with the exception of Babiana bainesii that ranges into southern tropical Africa. Babianas have aroused the interest of gardeners and horticulturists for centuries and their popularity today continues mainly in the form of colourful hybrids, probably originating from crosses between Babiana angustifolia and B. stricta that are commonly grown in rock gardens in mild climates, and as container plants in colder parts. The cultivation of pure species is confined largely to the attentions of specialist collectors. The wide diversity in flower colour and the very different flower shapes encountered (actinomorphic to tubular to strongly zygomorphic) places the aesthetic appeal of the species well above that of commonly grown hybrids but, as is so often the case, maintaining pure species in cultivation over the long term poses a far greater challenge than keeping hybrids alive. Several Babiana species are additionally desirable for the grower in being strongly fragrant, such as the sweetly scented B. ambigua, B. nana and B. odorata , and the strongly clove-scented B. fragrans. Some other species highly recommended for cultivation include deep violet forms of B. angustifolia , the oversized, sulphur-yellow blooms of B. pygmaea and the bicoloured blue-and-red flowers of B. rubrocyanea.

The corms of Babiana species are usually deep-seated and often found wedged between crevices of boulders, a strategy evolved to obstruct access by an array of animals which feed on the tasty corms including Chacma baboons, moles and porcupines. Those of B. villosa are also difficult to access as they are habitually found wedged between stones in heavy clay soils, which bake rock hard in summer. The corms commence active growth in autumn, grow rapidly through the winter months and bloom in spring . At the beginning of summer the ripe seeds are shed close to the mother plants from dry capsules as a result of the shaking action of wind, and lie dormant until rain falls the following autumn.

The flowers of Babiana villosa are unscented and pollinated by several species of monkey beetle which feed on the pollen, including Lepithrix ornatella, a small dark brown and yellow beetle with strong hind legs, which I have often seen on red-flowered forms of B. villosa near Tulbagh.",,"Babiana villosa adapts well to cultivation and is easily grown outdoors in temperate climates in rock garden pockets, raised beds and window boxes. Its dwarf nature also lends it to cultivation in deep containers with a diameter of 25-30cm, and in areas where winter temperatures drop to freezing, it has to be grown in the cool greenhouse in a position receiving bright light for as much of the day as possible.

Plant the corms 3cm deep in autumn in a sharply drained, gritty medium such as three parts coarse river sand and one part finely milled bark or potting compost. Water the plants heavily after planting and not again until the leaf shoots appear, then water heavily once per week during the winter growing period and do not allow the soil to dry out excessively over this time as this results in the plants aborting the developing inflorescences and entering dormancy prematurely. During the summer dormant period, keep the corms as dry as possible.

This species readily sets seed following hand pollination of flowers amongst different plants. It also multiplies by corm offsets of the mother corm, and by cormlets produced in the leaf axils in the subterranean part of the stem, the cormlets often concealed within the fibrous outer tunics of the corm neck. Sow the seeds in autumn in the same medium recommended for adult corms and keep moist by watering with a fine rose-cap. Fresh seeds germinate readily within four to five weeks and seedlings usually flower for the first time in their third season, in ideal conditions.

The corms and leaf bases are susceptible to mealy bug infestation, especially in late autumn and early winter. The foliage is subject to attack by rust fungi and Fusarium fungal dry rot in winter in insufficiently well ventilated environments, and is also susceptible to infection with a mosaic virus. In late spring, the leaves may be attacked by red spider mites as temperatures rise. In insufficiently well-drained media, the corms are attacked by the Fusarium fungus, seen as reddish lesions.",,,,,,,,
Lycium ferocissimum,Lycium ferocissimum, fragrant flowers,"This is an erect, woody and large shrub, which grows 2–3 m tall and spreads about 3 m wide. It has an extensive root system that is composed of small roots that spread laterally from the plant, but are generally not deep. The branches are drooping and spread widely. They carry small shoots, which have clusters of leaves that are surrounded at the base by small, light-brown scales. The stems are smooth and light brown, but become grey and rough as they mature, with the main stem carrying strong and thick spines, that are up to 150 mm long. The leaves are oval in shape, bright green and somewhat fleshy, usually borne in groups of 5–12 at the nodes of the stem.

The fragrant flowers are either solitary or in pairs, emerging from the leaf axils and are white or pale lilac, with darker purple markings from the throat. The flowers occur normally in winter and spring, but will also do so after rain in any season.

Smooth egg-shaped or rounded berries, with small raised dots, follow after flowering, starting off green and then turning orange-red or bright red when mature.","From the nightshade family, this species was first officially described in 1854 by a British botanist, John Miers, in Annals and Magazine of Natural History. It is one of 21 species of Lycium that occur in South Africa. The genus Lycium, pronounced ‘Ly’cium’, comes from the Greek word lykion, the name for a thorny tree with juice and roots used medicinally, from Lycia, a southwest region of Asia Minor. The species name is derived from the Latin words ferocissimum, ferocissimus, meaning ‘most ferocious’. This is probably due to the spines on the branches that are quite ferocious and protect the bush from many herbivores.","According to the Red List of South African plants, as checked on 30 October 2017, L. ferocissimum falls under the category Least Concern (LC). This species is a major weed in Australia and New Zealand. It was introduced in these countries as a hedge or barrier plant and it has naturalized throughout the places it was introduced to.

Lycium ferocissimum is not endemic to South Africa. It occurs on dry, stony and sandy flats and slopes in the Western Cape, from Saldanha to Agulhas and Knysna, and into the Eastern Cape and through the interior of South Africa to Free State and Mpumalanga. It also occurs in Lesotho.Most species from the nightshade family are self-pollinating, but also attract insects and ants. The berries of L. ferocissimum are eaten by birds and small animals. Seed from these plants is dispersed in the droppings of birds and small animals that ingest the seeds that are usually found inside the berries of the plant. L. ferocissimum flowers sporadically throughout the year and will, therefore, produce seed throughout the year, meaning that the seeds will be able to germinate anytime of the year, with spring and autumn seeds usually showing a better yield than those sown any other time of the year. These plants also produce suckers or shoots from the roots; propagation can also be by means of division of these suckers.",,"When pruned and kept under control, this plant makes a pleasant ornamental shrub, as well as a windbreak. Pruning this plant will encourage the plant to spread. This plant is tolerant of drought, salt spray and sand blasting making, it a good addition to a coastal garden. In fact it is tolerant of a wide range of climates and soil types, though it prefers light soils such as deep loams.

The spines of this plant are robust and long-lived and, therefore, make it an excellent hedging/barrier plant. Due to its spiny nature it is also tolerant of grazing.",,,"Medicinally, L. ferocissimum was used by the Xhosa people as a tonic to cure cattle ailments, such as poor appetite and abscesses. The Xhosa people also used the root in lukewarm water to treat swollen legs.

The leaves are nibbled off by grazing goats. In the wild it is known to provide shelter to native animals.

The berries are edible, but are known to produce narcotic symptoms.",,,,,
Plectranthus esculentus,Plectranthus esculentus,,"Plectranthus esculentus is a trailing, semi-succulent, deciduous herb that grows up to 600–1200 mm tall. It has tuberous roots that are fleshy and swollen like the ordinary potato.

They are characteristic of the plant. Leaves are oblong-elliptic, 50–80 × 13–25 mm, shortly scabrid, glandular on the lower surface and the leaf margins are denticulate. The leaf base is obtuse or cuneate and the apex is obtuse.

Inflorescences are in axillary racemes, 50–80 mm long. Individual flowers are boat-shaped, pedicellate and solitary; the corolla is 14–16 mm long, yellow and end to the throat . The flowers only appear after the plant has shed its leaves. The calyx is 4–5 mm and elongates to 10 mm long after flowering has taken place.

The fruits are small, round, brown nutlets that are 1 mm long. Flowering time is mainly in spring and P. esculentus is the only species within the genus to flower in this season.","The name Plectranthus, is derived from the Greek word plektron, which means ‘spur’, and anthos, which means ‘flower’, referring to the spur found at the base of the corolla tube. The specific epithet esculentus is a Latin word meaning ‘edible’ and this refers to its edible tubers. P. esculentus was first described by Nicholas Edward Brown in 1894, and this was done from plants that were collected and grown by John Medley Wood in the Durban Botanical Gardens. In 1934 this species was then introduced by a gentleman called Mr Hepburn to Kirstenbosch Botanical Gardens from Nigerian stock (2832/34).","Wild potato is able to grow in a variety of warm climates, ranging from humid, as in areas such as Equatorial Africa, to dry conditions in areas such as the Northern Cape. It has good underground storage organs, namely roots that are fleshy and swollen, and like the ordinary potato, has true tubers (underground stems that are modified and where new shoots are able to arise). These enable the plant to survive a period of dormancy when conditions for growth are not suitable.

The root crops are a great source of food in South Africa. The fact that wild potato is able to thrive under various conditions, such as marginal soil and climatic conditions across the country and is a great source of food, makes it a valuable source of food in Africa, and thus an important nutritional food crop. P. esculentus, as with many members of the genus, is not largely affected by insects, pests or diseases. Caterpillars of various moth and butterfly species have been reported to eat the leaves, but they can be removed manually by hand. Although not greatly affected by these conditions, they are, however, affected by an attack of soil nematodes, and when grown for commercial use, measures need to be taken in order to control this.",,"Being able to thrive under many climatic and soil conditions, the showy and profuse yellow flowers of Plectranthus esculentus are ideal in any garden, as they display their prolific flowers in winter and spring time, and their tubers are also a great source of nutrients for vegetable gardens. P. esculentus, however, does not grow in the Western Cape, during the winter-rainfall season.

Tuber planting: dig the soil to a depth of as least a full spade blade, remove stones which will interfere with tuber development, and break up clods of earth. Shape loose soil into ridges between half a metre and a metre apart, or in rows of mounds. Compost may be used, and in parts of Africa, it is customary to add some wood ash and even diluted cattle urine. Plant whole tubers or tubers cut into small sections 5–10 cm deep in the ridges or mounds, which should be separated by a spade blade from each other (25–30 cm)(Xaba & Croeser 2011). A single cluster of tubers from one plant, can produce about 100 new plants, by being cut into comparatively small sections. Planting tubers takes place with the onset of the early spring rains (end of August to early September in summer-rainfall areas)(Xaba & Croeser 2011).

Cultivation: although wild potato is adapted to relatively high rainfall conditions, it can survive drought. Rainfall of 750 mm (or watering to make up a shortfall) is preferred. Well-drained, sandy soils are preferred, as clay soils produce irregular tubers because of water-logging. It can be planted in clearings either as a sole crop, or grown together with a low-growing crop. Earth must continue to be heaped up around the plant to stimulate tuber production and to prevent exposed tubers going green and starting to sprout. Surface cultivation by hoe to remove weeds is usually done before the first month is up and then again a month later. Some varieties do grow in heavier soil near marshes and these areas are used in Zambia, Zimbabwe and Senegal during the dry season. In South Africa it grows in dry to subtropical bushveld (savanna) regions, but is often found on rocky hill slopes (Xaba & Croeser 2011).

Harvesting and storage of tubers: Either the whole plant with the tubers attached is removed, or the earth can be gently moved away and the mature tubers detached, leaving the main plant to continue growing. If the whole plant is removed, then a tuber should be left in place to rest in the soil and grow in the next rainy season. The tubers can be harvested four to six months after planting, depending on rainfall, soil and situation. The tubers are eaten fresh but can be stored in baskets in the shade or layered in dry sand for later use. They have a relatively short shelf life, however, and are vulnerable to damage, so must be handled carefully (Xaba & Croeser 2011).","Although commonly known as the wild potato, P. esculentus is not a member of the family Solanaceae, to which the common potato belongs, but a member of the mint family, namely Lamiaceae.",,"Wild potato is very popular as a source of food for indigenous people as it is the most nutritious tuber of all tuber vegetables and contains a high level of starch (80%). In addition to its high starch content, it contains 13% essential amino acids, which is essential to the body for constructing proteins, as well as contains an additional level of other important vitamins and mineral elements, such as calcium, iron and Vitamin A. Wild potato have been prepared and used like the common potato in Central Africa since earlier ancient times, when it was introduced by people that migrated southwards from Central Africa. The use and cultivation of it in local or rural communities have declined since then, hence classified as one of southern Africa’s important ‘lost crops’! The tubers are eaten like the common potato, and although they have a bland taste, there are varieties that are more pleasant and have the taste of mint. These tubers may be eaten raw, may be washed, the peels scraped off, then boiled, fried and even roasted. They are a delicacy in stews, soups and many other dishes.",,,,,
Adenopodia spicata,Adenopodia spicata,,"Evergreen shrub or scrambler to 10 m tall (rarely up to 30 m). Twigs hairy, slender, brown or grey, 5-angled, with prickles on the angles. Leaves alternate, bipinnate; petioles 35 - 90 mm long, prickly, with a conspicuous gland at the base. Rhachis (leaf axis) flattened or round, often prickly. Leaflet blade 7.5 - 20( - 24) mm long, 2.5 - 7( - 9) mm wide, oblong, rarely obovate; apex obtuse; base obliquely obtuse; surface sparsely to densely hairy; veins densely hairy on lower leaf surface; margin entire.

Inflorescence an axillary or terminal, erect panicle of spikes 15- 75mm long, borne in the southern hemisphere summer (November to January). Calyx tubular, lobes (1 -5) yellow to white. Corolla of 5 free petals, to 2.75 mm long, creamy, without markings. Plants with bisexual flowers. Stamens 10 ; filaments free, to 6 mm long, ovary superior, 1locular ; style 1. Fruit a glabrous pod breaking into segments, (50 - 160) mm long, (13 - 37) mm wide (borne from January to August) ; rind smooth, leathery, brown. Seeds dark brown, 7 - 10 mm long, 5 - 7 mm wide. Botha & Botha (2006) note that the spiny splinter bean is the host of the larvae of five species of butterflies and two of moths. One may deduce from the white scented flowers that it is probably moth-pollinated. The fruits break up into aerodynamic fragments, each containing one seed, evidence that the seeds are wind-dispersed.

Few herbivores would eat or even approach such a spiny plant.","The earliest collected specimens of this species were made by the prolific early-19th century collector, J.F. Drège, at the Bashee River (now Eastern Cape) and Port Natal (now Durban). They were described by E. Meyer (1836) as a species of Mimosa, but later moved to the genus Entada, and so this species will be found in some older books as Entada natalensis or E. spicata. Brenan (1986) resurrected the genus Adenopodia for some 10 African and South American species which do not resemble other members of Entada very closely. However, other opinion suggests that three South American species may be better placed in the genus Piptadenia (see Luckow in Lewis et al. 2005).

The generic name is derived from two Greek words, aden meaning a gland, and pous meaning a foot, referring to the conspicuous gland at the base of the petiole. The specific epithet spicata points to the arrangement of the flowers in spikes (Glen 2004).","Because it is so widespread and quite common where it occurs, it comes as no surprise that the spiny splinter bean is listed in the current South African Red List of South African plants Data Book (Raimondo et al. 2009) as being of Least Concern. It is not particularly threatened, and is not specifically protected.

This scrambler is a characteristic feature of forest, forest margins and bush clumps from the Eastern Cape to Limpopo. Boon (2010) cites a maximum altitude of 1340 m, suggesting that this plant is frost-tender. It is known from Swaziland but not from Mozambique. Holidaymakers in Durban can find typical populations of spiny splinter bean alongside paths in Pigeon Valley and Burman Bush Nature Reserves, among many other places. Both of these are no more than a few kilometres from the city centre and its facilities.

In Mozambique our species is replaced by the much less well-known Adenopodia schlechteri (Harms) Brenan, and in West Africa and the Congo Basin by the even more aggressively spiny A. scelerata (A.Chev.) Brenan.",,"Its natural range suggests that it is frost-sensitive and requires fairly abundant water, and so will not do well in colder, drier areas such as the Highveld or the Karoo. Carr (1994) reports that all his plants died of cold in Sandton, one of the warmest (but still not frost-free) parts of the Johannesburg area. Nevertheless, related trees of similar habitats (one thinks particularly of the fever tree, Acacia xanthophloea) do remarkably well in Pretoria, so this may be worth a try in the right circumstances there, too.

I do not recall seeing spiny splinter bean in nurseries, but as it is quite common outside of nature reserves, it is at least theoretically possible to collect seed in the wild legally, provided that you get the landowner's permission first. Fruits are ripe and harvestable most of the year, with the exception of the (southern) spring from September to December, according to Boon. Be aware that you will almost certainly lose some blood while collecting your seed, however. Carr reports relatively poor germination in standard mixtures, with about one seed in three producing a seedling. One should expect that, just as with many of its relatives, this species will produce a long taproot which will not tolerate injury or excessive disturbance.

One may expect that in its natural range this species will be eaten by the caterpillars of the five butterfly and two moth species it is known to host. Provided the numbers of caterpillars are reasonable, and they do not completely strip the plant of leaves, these are to be welcomed rather than controlled. If, however, numbers get out of hand, there are several organic deterrents that one can make up at home, usually based on mixtures of garlic, chillies and other herbs. Gardening magazines print recipes for these regularly.",,,"Boon (2010) mentions that the roots are used in traditional medicine to treat chest pains and syphilis. Watt & Breyer-Brandwijk (1962) add that the Zulu use a root infusion as an emetic and to fatten goats, and that Zulu sangomas use the crushed roots to increase their powers. Neither SANBI nor individual staff members can take any responsibility for any consequences, should anyone try any of these activities.",,,,,
Encephalartos cupidus,Encephalartos cupidus,,"Encephalartos cupidus is a dwarf cycad with a subterranean stem which grows up to about 150 mm long and 150 mm in diameter. E. cupidus normally produces many suckers of 10–15 per stem. Leaves are rigid, 0.5–1.0 m long, blue green and curved downwards near the apex. Median leaflets are about 100–150 mm long and 10–16 mm in diameter. The leaflets are leathery, without nodules and armed with 3 or 4 pungent teeth on both margins. Leaflets margins are not thickened or recurved and the apex is pungent. Basal leaflets decrease in size to a series of spines.

Male and female plants produce one cone, which is bright apple-green, per stem per season. Male cone turns to yellowish at maturity, is 180–300 mm long and 50–80 mm in diameter. Male cone starts to shed pollen during January–March. Female cone is 180–200 mm long and 120–140 mm in diameter. Female cone starts to break off during May–July to produce about 120 seeds.

","The species was described in 1971 by Robert Allen Dyer. The specific epithet cupidus is derived from the Latin, and means ‘desirable’ or ‘highly attractive’.","According to Raimondo et al. (2009), Encephalartos cupidus is Red-Listed as CR (Critically Endangered), as available evidence indicates that it meets all of the five IUCN criteria for critically endangered, and is therefore facing a high risk of extinction in the wild.

Encephalartos cupidus occurs within a restricted area of the Mpumalanga Drakensberg escarpment area, between the Blyde and Steelpoort Rivers in Mpumalanga, on steep slopes, rocky grassland and open forest. It used to have a much wider distribution, but it has suffered very heavily from plant collectors, so its range has been considerably reduced. The climate is hot, humid in summer and cool in winter, with the average annual rainfall of about 350–750 mm, which predominantly falls in summer. The plant is a frost-hardy and drought-tolerant. Species of Encephalartos are pollinated by insects and wind in the wild, but it is advisable to apply hand pollination in the garden for better results. Cycad cones release a distinctive odour at maturity to attract insects for pollination purposes. The fleshy outer covering layer of the seeds is a desirable food for a range of animals such as monkeys, birds, rodents and bats. Therefore, with some luck, the seeds are discarded some distance away from the parent plant in a hospitable environment in which they are likely to germinate.",,"Encephalartos cupidus can be used as a decorative container plant, a focal point in the garden, or can also be very effective used in group planting as its succulence is ideal for a low maintenance garden, as they require a minimum of water, and are undemanding in their soil and environmental needs.

Encephalartos cupidus can be easily propagated from seeds and suckers. It is a drought-tolerant, frost-hardy, and does well in the full sun.

To grow from seed, place cleaned seeds on their sides half buried on washed sand or a potting mix, and kept at about 28ºC. The medium must be kept moist, but not too wet, for as long as it takes to germination. As soon as the radicals of the sprouted kernels are 10–20 mm long, they can be planted singly in bags containing potting soil or some other suitable medium. One must wait until the seedlings develop one or two leaves before transplanting them individually into bags. Because of the long taproots cycad seedlings form, one must use tall, narrow, perforated, black, plastic bags of about 240 × 120 mm in size, for their initial establishment. Seedlings must be placed under shade for the first few years of growth and development. Initially the seedlings must be watered daily with a fine spray. After about a month, as their roots elongate, the frequency of watering should be decreased to about once a week. The seedlings can be transplanted into the garden when they are 3–5 years old.

When preparing to propagate from suckers, the soil should be dug away carefully to expose the base of the sucker where it joints the stem of the mother plant. One must use a clean, sharp knife or sharp spade to remove the sucker from the mother plant. Leaves of the sucker must be removed to reduce dehydration. The wound must then be treated with a fungicide and dried for about a week before planting the sucker into a sterile medium. The best time for removing suckers from the mother plant, is in spring and early summer, when the climate is warm for the quick establishment of the new plant.

Troublesome pests include scale insects, beetles and chewing insects. Scale insects cause great damage to cycad leaves by sucking the sap from them. Most scale insects can be controlled with regular and frequent applications of a horticultural soluble oil, such as white oil. Beetles seriously damage cycad plants by attacking the emerging young leaves. Control can be kept by application of contact or systemic insecticides, or one of the bacterial preparations available.",,,,,,,,
Lachenalia orchioides,Lachenalia orchioides,Sweet,"Lachenalia orchioides consists of a single white fleshy bulb about 10-20 mm in diameter, fine white adventitious roots, and two strap-like lanceolate leaves up to 150 mm long. In some individuals these leaves are covered in dark blotches, whereas in others they are plain green. They never have little bumps or pustules which are quite common in certain other Lachenalia species. The leaves start to emerge a few weeks after the first rains in autumn and wither naturally in late spring/early summer.

The inflorescence can grow up to about 200 mm tall and appears in early to middle spring. Typically in L. orchioides the inner perianth segments of the flower are significantly longer than the outer segments. The fruit are small capsules that ripen a month or two after flowering to release small shiny black seeds.

Flower colour varies depending on the variety, of which there are two: L. orchioides var. orchioides and L. orchioides var. glaucina. The flower colour of both varieties fades to a dull red brown.","The genus Lachenalia was first described by Joseph Franz Jacquin, son of a Baron Joseph Jacquin, who was studying the collections of these new plants in the Schönbrunn Palace Gardens near Vienna in the late 1700s. He named the genus after Werner de Lachenal, a professor of Botany in Basel, Switzerland.

The species Lachenalia orchioides was described some time later by William Aiton (1731-1793), one of the first curators of the Royal Botanical Gardens at Kew. Ochioides refers seemingly to its orchid-like scent, and the variety name glaucina refers to the blue-grey flowers of that variety.","The genus Lachenalia is generally restricted to the winter-rainfall parts of South Africa and Namibia. L. orchioides is found in the southern Western Cape. The variety L. orchioides var. orchioides occurs fairly commonly on flats or stony slopes from the Cape Peninsula to as far north as the Clanwilliam area, as far east as Swellendam and as far inland as Worcester. The variety L. orchioides var. glaucina is restricted to the eastern slopes of Table Mountain on the Cape Peninsula, often occurring in more shady habitats in rocky soils. Like all other Lachenalia species, L. orchioides is a typical winter-growing bulb that is summer-deciduous, i.e. it becomes completely dormant during the hot dry summer months in the Mediterranean-type climate of the Western Cape.

L. orchioides typically grows in stony soils favouring hilly slopes and flats but today much of this area has given way to farming and urban sprawl. L. orchioides var. orchioides tends to grow more in the open and L. orchioides var. glaucina favours more shady positions along forest margins and in low bush. The soil consists mainly of clay and is usually quite stony, which prevents predation by moles and/or porcupines. The sweet scent of the flowers indicates that they are probably pollinated by bees.",,"L. orchioides is very easy to grow and is one of the most rewarding species to grow as a pot subject. The soil medium should be fairly well-drained and consist of about half coarse washed sand and half finely sieved compost. This should be used to fill the lower two-thirds of the pot. The upper third should be pure sand with no loam or compost into which the bulbs are planted. This layer stays relatively dry preventing the bulbs from rotting if they get too wet, while the roots can safely penetrate the richer moister organic medium below. The plants should be kept in full sun and will grow very happily outside during the winter months, providing the temperature does not drop below freezing. In summer the bulbs should be kept dry, preferably in a cool position. One may either lift the bulbs and store them in paper bags or store them in their pots. They enjoy being repotted every 2-3 years with fresh medium.

They are easily propagated by leaf cuttings, which can be removed from the plant by slicing them at the base of the leaf blade. These leaves are then half-buried in a very sandy medium and left in a cool place out of direct sunlight. The soil should be kept on the dry side to avoid the leaves rotting while the humidity can be quite high: humid air and dry soil is the trick. Within a few months, small bulbils will appear along the cut edge at the base of the leaf. Eventually the leaf will wither but the bulbils can be planted like normal bulbs the following season. Flowering will take 1-2 years.

They are also easily raised from seed, which should be sown in autumn in a similar medium used for cultivation with a thin layer of soil placed over the seed. Water them gently but regularly in the first few weeks. The seedlings should germinate within about 2-3 weeks. Flowering will take 2-3 years.

They don't have many pests apart from snails and caterpillars (which can be removed by hand) and mealy bug which should be treated with a systemic pesticide. A rust fungus can be problematic and appears as orange blotches on the leaves, often developing where a leaf has been damaged by hail, for example. This is easily preventable (preferable) or treatable with common fungicides.

Not much fertilising is required for these bulbs as they are not generally very hungry, but they wouldn't be adverse to the odd splash of a dilute low-nitrogen liquid fertiliser.",,,,,,,,
Lampranthus haworthii,Lampranthus haworthii,,"Lampranthus haworthii is a tall, compact, erect subshrub that can grow as tall as 700 mm and as wide as 1 m. The leaves are fused at the base and are 40 x 6 mm, cylindrical in shape and bluish-green in colour. The flowers are 70 mm in diameter and are borne on a pedicel (stem), 20 to 40 mm long. Flower colour ranges from white, pale pink to light mauve. Flowering time is from mid-July to mid-September.

","The name is derived from the Greek words lampros (bright) and anthos (flower), referring to the large, showy flowers. Lampranthus is one of the largest genera in the Aizoaceae family. The genus consists of 227 species and 13 varieties. The species haworthii is named after a British succulent expert, Adrian Haworth (1768-1853).","Lampranthus haworthii occurs in the Little Karoo and Worcester/Robertson Karoo and is fairly common in and around the Worcester area. They are primarily winter rainfall plants. The genus Lampranthus occurs mainly in the Western Cape, Northern Cape and southern Namibia, although some species do occur in Eastern Cape as well. Plants are pollinated by insects at midday when flowers are fully open. Mainly bees do this job. The flowers open at 10 a.m. and close at 3 p.m. Swollen leaves full of water ensure the survival of the plant during long hot and dry spells, especially the summers in the winter rainfall areas. Brightly coloured flowers are like beacons to pollinators, ensuring good seed production.

Another adaptation for survival for mesembs is the abundance of seeds that are produced. Seeds are released by means of winged valves that open when wet. There are layers of membranes in these valves that ensure all the seeds are not released at one time. If this was the case and no follow-up rains fell, the seedlings would all die, which could compromise the very survival of a rare species. The more seeds there are, the better the chances of germination and ultimately the survival of the species.",,"To achieve optimum results, strike cuttings either in spring or autumn. Cuttings 100 -120 mm in length should be used, preferably tip cuttings with relatively new growth. Avoid old, woody or diseased material.

Plants can also be grown from seed. The best time for sowing seed is in spring or autumn, avoiding the cold of winter and the extreme heat of summer unless you have a controlled environment. Use flat, plastic seed pans for sowing. Under ideal conditions, fresh, viable seed will germinate within 3 - 5 days.

Sow seed in well-drained, loamy soil. The top layer can be sieved, coarse river sand. If you do cover the seed, cover 1 mm and no deeper! Water with a fine spray. Do not use water under force or a jet of water as this is likely to blast the seed out of its container.

A suggested garden layout is to combine this particular species with other related species in mixed or single colour groups. Other bright-coloured species are Lampranthus multiradiatus, L. aureus and L. reptans. L. glaucoides can also be used in rock gardens, on steep slopes or embankments as mass plantings. L. affinis is a good choice for shady spots. Remember that L. haworthii plants are tall, so plant at the back of your garden layout.

Not many pests attack these plants, although occasionally they suffer from soft brown scale or mealie bug. Use a systemic pesticide or oleum mineral oil.

Feeding tips: use compost, bone meal or a seaweed-based organic fertiliser, which will enhance healthy growth of plants.",,,,,,,,
Mondia whitei,Mondia whitei,Vanilla,"Mondia whitei is a perennial, woody, rather robust and vigorous climber that grows from a large tuberous rootstock. The roots are aromatic and apparently taste like ginger or liquorice and have an aroma reminding one of vanilla. The leaves are attractive, large (100-300 x 50-150 mm), opposite, with a deeply notched heart-shaped base and 30-55 mm long stalks. The stipules are well developed and consist of frilly teeth. The flowers are borne in branched inflorescences; they are large and relatively short-lived (die after 3-4 days). The reddish-purple corolla lobes are ± 14 mm long and usually have a green margin. Plants flower from October to March in the species southern distribution region, and from May to August in the northern distribution region. The large fruits (75-100 x 44 mm) are almost woody and contain many seeds.

","A farmer, A.S. White, from KwaZulu-Natal (at Fundisweni) sent roots to Kew via the Rev. Dr. J.C. Brown (Colonial Botanist at the Cape of Good Hope 1863-1866). He indicated that the plant was extensively collected by the Zulu people and used for promoting appetite or assisting digestion. Plants were successfully grown at Kew only after the third batch that was sent. When these plants eventually flowered J.D. Hooker realised that it was distinctly different to anything he knew. He placed it in a new genus (Chlorocodon) which refers to the bell-like green flowers. It was later moved to the genus Mondia which is derived from the Zulu word for the plant (umondi). The epithet whitei was given in honour of the farmer who first sent material to Kew.","The species is listed as Endangered (Raimondo et al. in prep.). It has become rare in the wild throughout its distribution range and is now of conservation value. A taxon is endangered when evidence indicates that it has a very high risk of extinction in the wild.

The main threat to the species is over-exploitation by local communities for subsistence and commercial purposes. It is reported to be extinct from the wild in its main area of exploitation in the Tugela River in South Africa (Cartan & Crouch 1998). In Kenya it is among the most heavily exploited species and is reported to have disappeared from the central province due to both over-exploitation and an increase in demand for agricultural land. Because the roots are harvested the plant is destroyed when utilised.

Various initiatives exist that strive to cultivate plants in order to satisfy the commercial demand and to reintroduce the species in the wild.

Mondia whitei is endemic to South, Central, East and West Africa. In South Africa the plant is restricted to the coast and midlands in KwaZulu-Natal, and to the Limpopo Province with some records from Swaziland. From here the distribution extends north to the southern parts of Sudan and west as far as Senegal.

Plants grow in dense bush in a variety of woodland and forest habitats. They have even been reported from shrubby swamp grassland. The species is frost-intolerant and favours moist tropical and subtropical situations. The genus Mondia is endemic to the tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, and two species are recognised.

Umondi has some of the largest flowers in the sub-family Periplocoideae. They have a fruity but unpleasant scent which becomes stronger later in the afternoon. They are probably pollinated by flies.

The plant grows as a climber with the basal portion of the stem usually leafless. The leaves and flowers mainly appear in the canopy of the supporting vegetation and are thus rarely noticed.",,"The flowers are very attractive and highly recommended for cultivation.

Nutritional value/food The early Portuguese in Angola boiled the leaves with butter or olive oil to substitute it for spinach. In South Africa the root is sometimes cooked with meat to enhance the flavour. The plant has great nutritional value as it contains the vitamins A, D, K and E, and the minerals, magnesium, zinc, iron, calcium and protein.

This species is easily cultivated from seed. Seeds are collected as the fruit starts to split open — pick the seeds off from their parachute-like tuft of hairs before it opens. The seeds are best sown fresh, but they can be stored for about a year under normal room conditions. Use wood-ash from a fire mixed with the seed to prevent attack by insects. Seed in South Africa ripens naturally toward the end of the winter (August), just before the spring rains start.

Sow fresh seed in spring when temperatures are warm. Fill seed-trays with compost and soil mixed in even amounts. Use a mixture of 50% seedling mix (or alternatively peat-moss or vermiculite) and 50% river sand. Sow seed and lightly cover with sand. Keep in a warm place that is moist at all times. Seedlings will germinate after ± 2(3-6) weeks. After germination protect the young plants from wind and sun and continue to water regularly - do not let the soil dry out completely. Seedlings grow rapidly in the growing season — up to 30 cm every 3-4 days. When the long stems develop, trail these as soon as possible to prevent them from getting all tangled. When plants are 15 cm tall, re-pot in bags or pots or directly in the garden when needed. Plants should be given plenty of growing space.

Suitable areas to grow plants are usually restricted to lower, frost-free elevations. The maroon umbrella-shaped flowers splashed with yellow-green edging on the corolla lobes are arranged in attractive clusters. The coconut-scent encourages visiting insect pollinators, which are especially active in the early morning and evening. After fertilization the horned pods (follicles/fruits) develop which can reach the size of a man's outstretched hand. Undisturbed, these plants are remarkably long-lived. One specimen has been known to grow on the veranda of a hotel for 50 years.

Plants are commercially available from various nurseries at reasonable prices. Climate dictates the rate of growth. Make sure that the plants have enough room to grow.",,,"Some tribes use the roots for making a tea that is used for the treatment of general pains and aches. The dried leaves are powdered and mixed with food and taken daily as a supplement.

Other sources indicate that the plant is further used as a symbol of peace; a sign of power; the treatment of hypertension, stroke, anemia, asthma, hangover, mastitis and allergies; it is also taken to improve sleep, enhance urination, ease birth pains, and as mouth freshener and toothbrush. The leaves serve as animal fodder and are consumed by humans as vegetables.

Flavourant/Drink The bitter tasting roots have a vanilla odour and a sweet after-taste and are used to make a beverage similar to ginger beer. In West Africa, the roots are used to make an energizing drink for wedding parties when the roots are brewed in alcohol. Mondia can be used as a tea. It has a sweet vanilla-like flavour. The roots are said to taste bitter at first and then sweet. The vanilla-like odour of the plant may cause it to be regarded as a novel African fragrance or spice. The roots are said to taste like liquorice, or ginger. As a potential African spice, the scent and taste of the roots has variously been described as reminiscent of vanilla, ginger, marzipan, cinnamon and liquorice and may thus make a useful food-flavouring agent.

Poison The seeds are believed to have once been used to make arrow poisons.

Fibres Strong fibres may be obtained from the stems and woven into ropes.",,,,,
Anchusa capensis,Anchusa capensis,,"Anchusa capensis is a vigorous herb with tall stems of blue flowers shooting up from clumps of bright green leaves. The long narrow leaves are soft, but rough and hairy when touched. Each plant has many flowering stems which grow up to 1 m tall. The stems are thick at the bottom getting thinner as they extend, with the new growth often a beautiful deep red.

In spring and summer, many blue flowers are carried on smaller branches in helicoid cymes, which are borne all the way up the top half of the stem and ends in a small cluster of flowers at the tip. Close up, the small flowers are beautiful with 5, bright blue petals and 5, feathery white scales in the centre, protecting the stigma and anthers. A white flowering form has been developed in horticulture, although it is not as striking as the bright blue one.

The seeds develop inside little green cups, which are formed by the 5 sepals that have united. Inside each cup 3 seeds or little nuts turn hard and black as they ripen, usually about a month after flowering. Every plant produces hundreds of seeds.

Individual plants are long-lived, for an annual or biennial, and a plant can live for over 5 years in ideal conditions. Seedlings readily appear around parent plants, which further increases the longevity of these plants in the garden.","The name Anchusa is derived from the Greek word anchousa, which makes reference to its use as a dye base for cosmetic paint obtained from Anchusa tinctoria root. The specific epithet capensis means ‘from the Cape’.","It grows throughout South Africa, at altitudes ranging from 60 to 3 200 m, preferring dry, sandy places and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadside verges. Anchusa capensis is widely distributed through the Western, Northern and Eastern Cape Provinces, Free State, Gauteng, and the drier areas of Mpumalanga, and extends into Namibia and Lesotho.

The genus Anchusa is a group of approximately 35 species found mostly in Europe, North Africa and West Asia. There are only two species in southern Africa, Anchusa capensis and A. riparia, which occurs in the Eastern Cape, Free State, Northern Cape, North West and Western Cape Provinces, and in Lesotho. Anchusa azurea is an introduced species, native to Europe and Western Asia, that has naturalised in the Eastern Cape, Free State, North West and Western Cape Provinces, but is not listed as invasive in South Africa. Anchusa is part of a group of the borage family called alkanets, which are noted useful plants with uses ranging from medical to edible. ",,"In the garden Anchusa capensis is a very easy plant adapting to most soils, surviving on very little water and seeding itself readily. The basic requirements are full sun and well-drained soil. In the western Cape, the plants grow during the wet winters and flower in late spring and early summer. If Anchusa capensis receives no water during the summer it dies after forming seed. This germinates freely the next winter. Although the Cape-forget-me-not is a biennial, it is best treated as an annual in the garden. The plants get very untidy in the second year and have to be cut back after flowering. When cutting back be very careful of contact with the rough leaves as they can cause an irritating rash, especially on softer skin.

If the plants are watered during summer, the Cape-for-get-me-not keeps on going and can easily be grown as a summer annual. At Kirstenbosch National Botanical Garden, they make a beautiful display, flowering with the pink Diascia integerrima from the Drakensberg and white Nemesia fruticans and osteospermums.

Anchusa capensis is easy to propagate from seed, which can be sown almost any time of the year. For a spring display, sow the seeds in late summer and for a summer display sow the seeds in winter. Sow the seeds in a seed tray filled with well-drained soil and cover them with a thin layer of sand. Place the tray in the shade and water well. Keep the soil moist; watering once a day should be enough. Germination is usually very good and within a week or two. The seedlings can be potted up as soon as they are large enough to handle and grown on before planting in the garden.

Very few pest or plant diseases are noticed on Anchusa capensis in a garden setting.",,,"Anchusa capensis has no recorded medicinal uses, but the leaves are edible and are eaten like spinach by the Sesotho people. The flowers are also edible, and can be added to salads or desserts. Anchusa tinctoria is cultivated in Europe for its red dye which is extracted from the plants roots using oils or wine. The dye is used in pharmaceutical salves and wood stains, imitating rosewood or mahogany. The dye needs to be in an oil base to impart the reddish colour. In a water base it remains a shade of dull brown. Many species of Anchusa have been recorded by traditional healers in some form or the other either medicinally or as a useful dye since the early days, dating as far back as the 1800s.

The dried flowers of Anchusa azurea are recorded as being used to treat inflammation. In the 1900s, Anchusa. tinctoria was used for anything from ulcers and inflammation, to scrapes and scratches. A vinegar infusion was applied for leprosy to kidney stones and to drive out smallpox or measles and was even used to treat snake bites. However, much of this lore from the 1900s is inaccurate, but clearly Anchusa was recognized as a wonder herb.

Modern traditional uses do agree with some of the old lore:

Anchusa azurea is used as an antitussive, depurative, diaphoretic and diuretic. Poultices made from dried flowers can be used for inflammation, but the internal use of this species is cautioned against, as it contains cynoglossoine which has a paralyzing effect.

Anchusa officinalis is used as a demulcent and expectorant in homeopathy. It is used to treat stomach and duodenal ulcers.",,,,,
Cola greenwayi,Cola greenwayi,,"Cola greenwayi is a small to medium-sized perennial, evergreen tree of 3-25m high. Stem bark is grey-brown or dark brown, rough, flaking with young branches russet to light cinnamon brown or tomentose (densely covered with short, soft, felted hairs) at first, mixed with stellate or bunched hairs which fall readily.

Stipules are subulate-lanceolate to linear, 3-6mm long, dark to light brown or grey tomentose, and fall off early. Leaves simple, alternate, elliptic to oblanceolate, up to 270×75mm, glabrous at maturity, dark green above, paler green below, drooping, tapering at apex and base, margins entire, petiole up to 10-65mm long, with tomentose apical swelling below leaf base (pulvinus).

Inflorescences are one-flowered, axillary, solitary or fascicled and crowded on branchelets between the leaves. Flowers are unisexual, rarely bisexual, about 5×12mm, coloured by dark rusty brown, dense hairs, in leaf axial, in tight clusters along woody stems. Floral pedicels are jointed near the base, arising from sessile imbricating bracts which are 1.5-3.5mm long, without petals, sepals covered with rusty hairs, pedicels 7-20mm long, densely stellate-purbescent, hairs dark to light brown short or long, calyx 4-6-lobed almost to the base at flowering time, dorsally stellate-pubescent (with star-shaped hairs).

Female flowers with sessile ovary, densely stellate-pubescent, about 2 or 3mm wide, with a ring of rudimentary stamens around base, carpels 4-5 or less by abortion, orange yellow to deep orange. Flowering time is from October to January.

Fruit consist of 3-5 carpels, each about 20mm wide, joined in a ring, covered with dense short, soft, rusty-red hairs when young, yellow when ripe. Fruits ripen from November to May.","The name Cola is a West African vernacular name and greenwayi is after Percy J. Greenway (1897-1980), curator of the East African Herbarium and co-author of Kenya Trees and Shrubs. There are two species of Cola in South Africa: C. greenwayi and C. natalensis.","Cola greenwayi is Red Listed as Least Concern (LC).

This species has a mainly tropical east-African distribution. In South Africa, it occurs in Mpumalanga and northern KwaZulu-Natal. It grows in evergreen forests and dense woodlands, ranging from sea level to steep mountain slopes to altitudes of about 1100metres. Cola greenwayi can be confused with C. natalensis but differs in that C. natalensis lacks brownish hairs on young branches, fruit is obovate and up to about 40mm long, and the rind is hard and thick.

Cola greenwayi grows in high-rainfall montane and sand forest regions.",,"Cola greenwayi is grown from seed or cuttings. Sowing time is all year round, and fresh seeds germinate reliably.

Erica annectens,Erica annectens,,"‘Some people worry that artificial intelligence will make us feel inferior, but then, anybody in his right mind should have an inferiority complex every time he looks at a flower.’ ~Alan C. Kay.

Erica annectens is an erect to spreading, perennial, dwarf shrub usually about 0.6 m tall, but can reach 1.0–1.5 m in height. The rambling branches are stout and rigid, with leaves 4–6-nate. The flowers are produced in fours at the ends of lateral branches, forming one or more whorls around the stem. The corolla is 20–24 mm long, tubular, curved and glabrous, i.e. smooth and without hairs. The corolla is orange to pale red, paler below with spreading paler lobes. Anthers are dark-coloured and muticous, i.e. blunt, lacking an awn or point, and are just visible at the mouth of the corolla tube. The style is smooth, as is the ovary, which is wider than it is long. E. annectens flowers in mid-summer, from December to February. In the field Erica annectens may be confused with E. quadrisulcata (orange rock-heath) which has 4–12 golden-orange flowers at the ends of main branches, of similar shape and size also flowering in mid-summer, but the flowers do not have paler tips. E. annectens is most closely related to E. pinea (pine-leaf heath) which has white or yellow, tubular flowers, flowering at the same time of the year, but it does not occur on the Peninsula and it has more spreading and blunter leaves, and smaller, differently set and shaped anthers.","Dating back to the time of the ancient Greek civilization when Theophrastus and Pliny walked the earth, you would have heard them use the term erike as they described the heath-like shrubs around them. In 458 BC, Aeschylus wrote a play called Agamemnon in which the fall of Troy is told to have been signaled from the mountain tops by the light of the fires of dried ereika. Ereiko means to break, which may describe the plant’s brittle stems that would easily split with a little force. A number of references, though, suggest that ereiko describes the plant’s ability to break up bladder stones, once an infusion of the leaves was ingested (Hyam & Pankhurst 1995). Ericaceae (heath family) is a worldwide floral family consisting of about 116 genera and approximately 3 000 species of shrubs, climbers, herbs and even a few trees. Erica is the largest genus within this family. The specific epithet annectens, means hanging or clinging, which refers to the natural habitat, and habit, of this species.","As South Africans we are custodians of the world’s richest temperate flora. We can say this confidently because of the 370 000 species of mosses, ferns and seed plants currently estimated to exist on our planet, 20 456 species are recorded here. Of this number 65% (13 256 species) occur nowhere else in the world. This is astounding when you consider that South Africa only accounts for 2.5% of the world’s land surface! So, what we have is precious. One of the many species exemplifying this precious condition is Erica annectens. According to the Red List of South African Plants (Raimondo et al. 2009 ), E. annectens is listed as VU (Vulnerable) as it is a rare, highly localized habitat specialist found nowhere else in the world except on rocky slopes of the Cape Peninsula, Noordhoek to Simon's Town. But, what does ‘Vulnerable’ actually mean? Raimondo et al. (2009) explain that, ‘A species is Vulnerable when the best available evidence indicates that it meets at least one of the five IUCN criteria for Vulnerable, indicating that the species is facing a high risk of extinction in the wild.’ See http://redlist.sanbi.org/redcat.php for a detailed description of the five Red List categories. Erica annectens is listed as VU D2. This means that the area that this species physically occupies is either < 20 km² or the number of known localities is ≤ 5. There is, therefore, a real and probable future threat that could drive this species to CRITICAL or EXINCT in a very short time. What is this threat? E. annectens is threatened by competition from alien invasive plants on Noordhoek Mountain, at Silvermine and the Swartkop Mountains well as by too frequent fires on Muizenberg Mountain.

The genus Erica contains a total of 860 species and these may be found growing from the southernmost tip of Africa to the northernmost tip of Norway. Of these 860 species, South Africa is home to 760, with the highest concentration occurring in the Caledon District, where more than 235 species occur within 4 500 square kilometers (Schumann et al. 1992). Erica annectens is endemic to the Cape Peninsula growing on steep, moist, peaty rock ledges and cliff faces from Noordhoek to Simon's Town. Fynbos ecology is absolutely mind-blowing! Nutrient-poor soils, hot dry summers alternating with cool wet winters, recurrent fires and an elaborate web of animal-plant interactions have created an ancient vegetation type with a complex ecology, a delicate balance and an explosive diversity. Ericas are one of the four main constituents of this vegetation type—bulbs, proteas and restios being the other three. Erica annectens is an example of an endemic species and it is a habitat specialist. What does this mean? A ‘generalist’ is an organism that is able to thrive under a wide variety of conditions, because it is able to adapt to different conditions rapidly. These organisms are able to obtain what they need to survive (e.g. shelter, water, nutrients) from a variety of places, and should their environment change they will simply change with it. Everything about a ‘specialist’, from its biology, anatomy, ecology etc., is designed to access particular resources under particular conditions. Specialists, therefore, are experts at what they do but to their own detriment. If their environment changes (perhaps their environment gets hotter or, in the case of animals, the particular plant that they eat disappears, for example) that species will most likely become extinct. So, Erica annectens is good at what it does. It’s a low-growing cliff dweller found at high altitudes on the rocky mountains of the Cape. But, it is difficult to predict what will happen to it if its environment changes or is damaged. A species is described as an ‘endemic’ when it is unique to a particular geographic location, e.g. this species can only be found on the Cape Peninsula and nowhere else in the world. A ‘narrow endemic’ is even more restricted. Not only confined to a specific geographic region, this species can only be found on a particular soil type and/or habitat e.g. the south-facing slope of a particular ravine between 100–200 m above sea level, under rocks. Endemic species are also at risk when their environment changes because they have adapted to a very particular suite of conditions and have a small population size over a small area. Erica annectens is most likely pollinated by sunbirds.",,"Fynbos ecology is absolutely mind-blowing!

Ficus abutilifolia,Ficus abutilifolia,,"Ficus abutilifolia is a small to medium-sized, deciduous to semi-deciduous tree up to 15 m high, though it seldom exceeds 5 m. The bark is whitish to yellowish white and smooth, powdery or somewhat flaking, and it is this conspicuous bark that is immediately apparent. The trunk is usually twisted or contorted, the branchlets stout and glabrous (lacking hairs) and marked with leaf and stipular scars.

The leaves are broadly ovate and heart-shaped to almost round and are cordate at the base, ranging in size from 75-200 x 65-180 mm. They are glabrous on both surfaces, occasionally with velvety hairs beneath, with 4-9 pairs of secondary veins, entire wavy margins and a petiole up to 120 mm long.

The fruit, which are 15-25 mm in diameter, are borne singly or in pairs in the leaf axils on terminal branchlets, and are smooth to slightly hairy. They may be sessile or on short, stout stalks up to 15 mm long and are green becoming yellow or red when ripe. Read more about what is unusual about fig fruits and their pollination on the Ficus trichopoda page.

Ficus abutilifolia is a fairly distinct species but does resemble F. tettensis and F. glumosa which are readily distinguished by their smaller, hairy leaves and hairy branchlets.",,"The large-leaved rock fig is generally encountered on rocky hillsides, rocky outcrops and along streams. The species is always found on or near rock outcrops (Burrows & Burrows 2003), and while it is often found on granite, it grows also on sandstones, basalts and ironstone. The altitudinal range is from sea level to around 1000 m and although able to tolerate light frost, it enjoys lower altitudes and hotter conditions. It is restricted to the African continent and here it has a widespread distribution, occurring in the South African provinces of KwaZulu-Natal, Mpumalanga, Gauteng, and the North-West up into Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Namibia, Malawi, Zambia, Ethiopia, Somalia and west to Guinea.

The species name abutilifolia stems from the resemblance of its leaves to those of Abutilon, a popular ornamental genus (Burrows & Burrows 2003). The very apt Tswana name momelantsweng translates as 'cling to rock' (Palmer & Pitman 1972). It is from the Latin word ficus, which refers to both to the fig tree and the fig, that the generic name Ficus is derived (Burrows & Burrows 2003). The genus Ficus is found throughout the tropical and subtropical regions of the world and is comprised of between 750 and 800 species. The greatest concentration of figs is found in SE Asia, numbering approximately 500 species, with roughly 100 species occurring on the African continent. The southern African region is home to 48 of these.

The genus belongs to the relatively large Moraceae family, comprising a total of 37 genera and roughly 1 100 species. Features characteristic of the family include the presence of a latex (often milky), stipules serving as apical bud sheaths, unisexual flowers and simple leaves. Notable members of the Moraceae include the well-known mulberry (Morus alba) and the common fig ( Ficus carica ), both having been in cultivation since early times.

As mentioned, Ficus abutilifolia is a species most commonly associated with rocky outcrops and relatively hot and dry conditions. The ability of the roots to reach great depths of up to 60 m and that these may reach sources of underground water, has been recorded. This species is one of a few South African rock-splitting figs which include F. cordata, F. glumosa, F. ilicina, F. ingens and F. tettensis. Pollination of flowers within the receptacles is carried out by tiny wasps which enter through the ostiole, a small opening at the tip of the receptacle. Two wasp species presently known to effect pollination in F. abutilifolia are Elisabethiella comptoni and Nigeriella fusciceps, recorded from Malawi and Nigeria respectively (Burrows & Burrows 2003). The tasty fruits are enjoyed by people, and by a host of birds, fruit bats, monkeys and baboons, bushbuck, bushpig, duiker, klipspringer, nyala and warthog.",,"The large-leaved rock fig is best grown from seed. The fruits should be collected when soft and ripe, and opened to allow them to dry for a day or two. The sieved seeds or crumbled up desiccated fruits can then be distributed over the surface of the growing medium and covered lightly with this same medium, a recommended one being equal parts of washed river sand and vermiculite mix. Sow in spring. Seedling trays with a depth of 70 mm are recommended for sowing. Germination can be expected between 10 days to a month from sowing depending on temperature and the freshness of the seed-fresh seed and warm temperatures will favour more rapid germination. Place the trays in a warm, well-lit and ventilated position and keep moist, and preferably treat with a fungicide such as Captan to reduce the occurrence of fungal problems. Seedlings should be placed in a sunny position and eventually transplanted into a well-drained sandy mix rich in organic matter.

Cuttings are an alternative method to seed sowing although this species does not root as readily as some of the other fig species. According to Ernst van Jaarsveld (pers comm.) it is best to take softwood or semi-hardwood cuttings in spring, around 200-250 mm long. Remove the lower leaves from the stem. Insert into a washed river sand mix and place in a misting unit, or if this is not available, place the tray with cuttings inside a clear plastic bag to reduce the adverse effects of transpiration. These should root within a month and be ready for transplanting in a further 3-4 weeks into a rich, well-drained medium. This attractive and interesting species certainly deserves more recognition in horticultural and gardening circles. It makes a fine showy subject planted among rocks in the garden, or on old walls and similar unwanted structures, where its pale spreading roots and rounded crown can create quite a feature. Beware though to avoid close proximity to plumbing, sewerage, pools and buildings. F. abutilifolia will reward you with an abundance of wildlife and a marvellous exhibition of nature.",,,"The uses for Ficus abutilifolia so far documented are somewhat limited and mostly medicinal in nature. The wood is light and soft, yet tough (Burrows & Burrows 2003); it becomes a yellow-brown when dry and works easily and polishes well but on the whole it is not of much use to people. Decoctions prepared from the leaves are used in promoting fertility in humans and good crop yields, and the milky latex derived from the plant is used to remove skin warts (Ellis 2001). In addition, bark decoctions are taken by men as a strengthening tonic (Hutchings 1996).",,,,,
Hibiscus tiliaceus,Hibiscus tiliaceus,,"H. tiliaceus is a large, stout, open-branched shrub or small tree with spreading branches. It grows to a height of 3-6 m. Stems long and flexible. Young branches, buds and flowers densely covered with short soft hairs. Bark pale greyish brown, smooth or with lenticels (small corky dots on young stems allowing gas exchange between plant and environment), becoming rough with age.

Large dark green simple leaves are heart-shaped to almost circular, or broader than long, 30-150 mm in diameter or larger; 5- to 9-veined from the base, veins prominent, each of the main veins with a slit or elongated gland near the base; velvety white to greyish, densely and finely tomentose below , olive-green and glabrescent (becoming hairless) on the upper surface ; apex abruptly pointed; base deeply lobed; margins entire or minutely toothed; petiole (leaf stalk) up to120 mm long , with stellate (star-shaped) hairs, sometimes hairless; stipules ( small appendages at the base of leaves) broad, up to about 30 x 15 mm, ovate-cordate, caducous (falling off during the life of the organism), sheathing the stem, falling off early to leave a scar almost all the way around the stem.

The inflorescence seems to be cymose (as in an inflorescence in which the main axis and all side branches end in a flower) but the apparently terminal flowers are really axillary ( arising from the axil of a leaf). Bracts (modified leaves associated with flower) ovate; paired with the stipules, each pair occupies the complete circumference of the stem, leaving a circular scar after falling off.

Flowers large, showy, up to 120 mm in diameter, yellow with dark maroon or blackish centre, deepen to orange or apricot as they mature, flowers fading after 1 day and turn orange-red before they are shed. Flowers have five free petals 60 -70 x 40-60 mm, obovate, twisted. the stamens many, united into a distinctive tube up to 25 mm long around the style.

Fruit an ovoid or subglobose capsule, tapering to the apex, 20-25 mm long, covered with golden hairs. Seeds almost kidney-shaped, 4.5 x 3 mm, smooth.

Growth rate of the plant is fast.","Hibiscus is the Latin name of the marsh mallow. The genus is found in warm countries throughout the world. There are 59 species of Hibiscus in southern Africa, occurring in Namibia, Botswana, Swaziland, Lesotho and all provinces of South Africa. The specific epithet tiliaceus refers to its resemblance to the related Tilia (lime and linden) species. H. tiliaceus grows along lagoons, hence the name `lagoon hibiscus'. This is a very aberrant species, providing a link with the genera Azanza and Thespesia.","H. tiliaceus occurs along the coast from the Eastern Cape to Zululand and extends into the tropics where it is widespread along the seashore on margins of watercourses or in tidal-zone thickets. It fringes estuaries and coastal areas along rivers and lagoons.

The Malvaceae family sometimes includes three other families: Tiliaceae, Bombacaceae and Sterculiaceae. A useful field characteristic of Malvaceae is the frequent presence of star-shaped hairs that often impart a rough texture to the leaves and are best detected with the aid of a hand lens.",,"In South Africa the best known members of the cotton family are probably the colourful and popular garden shrubs of the genus Hibiscus . Species of the genus may be grown from seed, which is best sown in September when the warm weather begins. The seeds will germinate in about a fortnight. The plants may also be grown from cuttings. They grow in ordinary garden soil in a sunny or semi-shaded position. Detailed cultivation information may be obtained by cross-reference to Hibiscus praeteritus

H. tiliaceus is suitable for marginal and exposed positions but is not suited to areas which experience frost. It likes plenty of water and exposure to full sun. It is more successfully grown in humid subtropical districts.",,,The stems and branches are long and flexuous and are used as living fence posts and fish kraals. The fibre from the bark makes excellent string and rope and is used as such in hut building. This species has also been used as a street tree in Durban.,,,,,
Leucospermum cuneiforme,Leucospermum cuneiforme,,"Leucospermum cuneiforme is usually a stout shrub 1.5-2 m tall but can reach up to 3 m. It has a large persistent, underground rootstock from which many stems arise. The branches at the base of the plant are covered with warts and pustules - this is a unique characteristic and a sure identifier of this species. Leaves are leathery, green, hairless, wedge-shaped (cuneate), with 3-10 apical teeth. The flowerheads are large, oval, 50-90 mm wide. They are produced at the tips of the branches, usually singly, occasionally in groups of 2 or 3. Flower colour varies from locality to locality.

Most often the flowerheads are bright yellow ageing to orange but there is some variation: some have orange styles, or red-tipped styles, some age a reddish orange, some a soft orange, some a pinkish orange, many have an attractive bicoloured (yellow and orange) effect. Flowerheads are produced at any time of the year, but the main flowering season is spring to late summer (August-February). Seeds are released about two months after flowering. They are small nuts covered by a soft, fleshy, white skin.","The genus Leucospermum is named from the Greek leukos meaning white, and sperma seed, referring to the white or light-coloured seeds of many species. This species is named for its wedge shaped leaves, from the Latin cuneus, wedge or wedge-shaped, and folium, leaf. Leucospermum cuneiforme was probably first collected by Oldenland, the Dutch East India Company's master gardener at the Cape, in 1689 on an expedition that crossed the Outeniqua Mountains in the vicinity of Attaqua's Kloof. This species was first described by N.L. Burman in 1768 in his Florae Capensis Prodromus from specimens collected by Oldenland (Rourke). Over the past two hundred years a number of additional species, including L. attenuatum and L. ellipticum, were described using variable characteristics such as leaf length, leaf toothing and inflorescence size, but these are now regarded as synonymous with L. cuneiforme (Rourke).","Leucospermum cuneiforme grows on sandstone slopes and flats in the Western Cape and Eastern Cape, from sea level to 1000 m, from Greyton in the Caledon district, along the southern and eastern coastal belt and adjacent mountain ranges, the Riviersonderend, Potberg, Langeberg, Outeniqua and Swartberg Mountains, to just beyond Qolora Mouth in the Kentani district of the Eastern Cape. It is usually found as a few scattered plants.

This is the most widespread pincushion. No other pincushion occurs in as wide a range of habitats, vegetation types and climates as Leucospermum cuneiforme. It is found in the winter rainfall area, summer rainfall area and areas were rainfall is evenly spread throughout the year. It grows in fynbos, arid fynbos and on the fringes of the Little Karoo, in grassveld, subtropical coastal dune forest and in the margins of cool temperate evergreen forests. However, it is always found in soils derived from Table Mountain Sandstone, Witteberg Quartzite or stabilised coastal sand of Tertiary origin. Leucospermum cuneiforme is extremely fire resistant. In a fire the above-ground parts are burned, but the woody rootstock survives sending out multiple stems. Plants that have never been burned develop a single main stem and a tree-like habit.

The brightly coloured, unscented flower heads are pollinated by nectar-feeding Sugarbirds and Sunbirds. The birds perch on the flowerhead and probe into the flowerhead in search of nectar, and in so doing their heads and necks come into contact with the pollen presenters and stigmas at the tips of the styles. The flowerheads are also visited by bees and beetles but they don't come into contact with the pollen presenters and thus do not do any pollinating.

The fleshy coating on the seeds is an elaiosome that attracts ants. The seeds fall from the flowerheads when ripe, and ants carry them away to their nests where they consume the elaiosome, but do not harm the seeds. In this way the seeds are dispersed and stored safely underground. This is known as myrmecochory. After a fire, the seeds in the ant nests germinate to regenerate the population. Leucospermum cuneiforme thus employs two strategies to overcome fire: resprouting and myrmecochory.",,"Grow Leucospermum cuneiforme in a sunny spot in well-drained (sandy), acidic soil where there is free circulation of air. Prune regularly to shape. Like most members of the Protea Family, Leucospermum cuneiforme is adapted to nutrient poor soils and has fine and sensitive roots that cannot cope with strong fertilisers. Feed with diluted liquid fertiliser or low doses of general fertiliser, or slow release fertiliser, and mulch generously and frequently with well-rotted compost. Steer clear of manure. Leucospermum cuneiforme will tolerate summer drought, but performs best with a good weekly watering throughout the year. Leucospermum cuneiforme is also wind tolerant and should survive outdoors in zone 9 (-7 to -1°C; 20 to 30°F).

Leucospermum cuneiforme is ideal for the fynbos garden. It is also suitable for the shrubbery, rockery, slopes and terraces in non-fynbos gardens, and summer-rainfall gardens, provided the soil is well-drained and not alkaline and the site is not humid. It is also suitable for medium to large containers. Leucospermum cuneiforme is relatively fast growing, flowering in its third year from seed. It is long-lived.

Propagate Leucospermum cuneiforme by seed or cuttings. Sow seed in late summer to autumn (March-May). Use a well-drained medium e.g. two parts coarse sand: one part leaf mould or fine-milled pine bark and one part loam. Cover the seeds with coarse, clean sand or fine-milled bark and keep warm and moist. Seeds need alternating cold night and warm day temperatures of 4-10°C to 15-20°C to initiate germination. Such temperatures are typical of autumn in the Western Cape and indicate the start of the rainy season. Germination can be improved if the seeds are soaked in a 1% solution of hydrogen peroxide for 24 hours. This oxygenates the seed and softens and loosens the seed coat, which should be rubbed off.

Treatment with Instant Smoke Plus Seed Primer will also enhance germination. Watering the seed tray with a fungicide will prevent fungal disease. Germination occurs in 3-4 weeks and the young seedlings are ready to be potted up as soon as they have developed their first set of true leaves. Use a well-drained, acidic soil mix suitable for fynbos and place them in a lightly shaded, well ventilated area. Seedlings are best planted into the garden when at least one year old.

Take semi-hardwood tip cuttings or heel cuttings from the current season's growth in summer-autumn (Dec-March). Choose vigorous, disease free material. Treat with rooting hormone and place in a well-drained medium and place in a mist unit with bottom heat of 24°C. Good air circulation is required to prevent fungal infection. Rooting occurs in about five weeks, and the rooted cuttings should be hardened off for three weeks before being potted. Use a sandy, well-drained soil mix suitable for fynbos and grow on for at least a year before planting out.",,,,,,,,
Podranea ricasoliana,Podranea ricasoliana,,"Podranea ricasoliana is a vigorous, woody, rambling, evergreen climber without tendrils. The leaves are compound and a deep glossy green. It sends up many tall strong stems — 3 to 5 m up to 10+ m high if left unchecked — that have long spreading branches with a graceful arching habit.
Large bunches of fragrant lilac-pink, trumpet-shaped, foxglove-like flowers are produced all summer long (November to March). The flowers are carried at the branch tips of the new growth, and are held above the foliage. The flowers terminate a branch, After flowering new side branches develop behind the spent flowers. The fruit is a long, narrow, straight, flattened capsule. The seeds are brown, ovate and flat, in a large rectangular papery wing. It tends not to produce many fertile seeds.According to the Red List of South African Plants, Podranea ricasoliana is assessed as Vulnerable (VU). It is a highly localized endemic found in a restricted habitat that is not protected. Although locally common its habitat is at risk of degradation by subsistence farming, wood harvesting, invasive alien plants and fires.","Many South African botanists suspect that this climber may not be indigenous to southern Africa and that it was introduced here by slave traders. All the sites where both Podranea ricasoliana and Podranea brycei are found have ancient connections with slave traders who frequented the eastern coast of Africa long before the 1600s. It has become such a widely grown garden plant in all the warmer parts of the world that it may prove difficult to find its real origin. Podranea ricasoliana is a member of the Bignoniaceae, a family of ±109 genera, mainly trees, lianes and shrubs from mostly tropical regions particularly in South America. There are 8 southern African genera, plus 2 that have become naturalised. The member of this family most well known to South Africans is the jacaranda, Jacaranda mimosifolia. This tree is not indigenous to Africa; it comes from South America, but has become naturalised in the warmer parts of South Africa. Indigenous species include the Cape honeysuckle, Tecomaria capensis and the sausage tree, Kigelia africana.

The name Podranea is an anagram of Pandorea, a closely related Australian genus, in which Podranea was first classified. Pandora means all-gifted. She was the first woman of Greek mythology and was given the box that contained all man's ills. When she opened it, they all flew out.

The flowers are often visited by carpenter bees (Xylocopa species).The Port St Johns creeper is well-known to gardeners in southern Africa, Mediterranean countries, California, Florida, Australia and Asia, and has become a popular container plant in Europe, where it is over-wintered in heated greenhouses. It was grown in the early 1800's in British conservatories, and La Mortola Botanic Garden near Monaco.","The genus Podranea contains Podranea ricasoliana, found at the mouth of the Mzimvubu River at Port St Johns, roughly half-way between East London and Durban on the Eastern Cape coast; and Podranea brycei, the Zimbabwe creeper, which has been collected from the ruins of Great Zimbabwe near Musvingo in Zimbabwe, and from the surroundings of Nova Sofala, on the Mozambique coast south of Beira. These two species differ only in the hairiness of the flowers and the size of the leaves. As it is virtually impossible to tell them apart when seen growing together many botanists regard them as the same species. ",,"Podranea ricasoliana is fast-growing and easy in cultivation. It does best in full sun, in nutrient-rich, well-drained soil and benefits greatly from regular applications of well-rotted compost and plenty of water in summer. An established plant is tolerant of heat, strong sunlight, wind and periods of drought. It is tolerant of light frost and should survive a winter minimum of -7ºC / 20ºF (zone 9) although it is better suited to frost-free gardens. Young plants require protection from frost, and if an established plant is cut down by frost, it should resprout in the spring. Because it is so vigorous and so fast it can get a bit out of control and may grow into gutters and roof overhangs and into trees, particularly in subtropical regions. It will need pruning to be kept neat; to keep it down to shrub size it should be pruned back hard every year. Pruning will also improve flowering. The best time for pruning is in winter or early spring just before new growth commences. It is known to sprout where prunings have been thrown, and it is an invasive, garden-escape in parts of Queensland and New South Wales in Australia and in New Zealand.

This is an excellent plant for arbors, pergolas and carports and is a valuable shade-giving plant in a hot climate. It is ideal for an informal hedge or planted against a wall or a fence to create a screen. It is a useful rambling ground cover for an embankment as the stems root wherever they touch the soil, forming large, swollen water- and soil-holding root clumps. It is suitable for the coastal garden. It looks good in a large container and is a candidate for espalier and can be pruned and trained into a weeping standard. It has no tendrils, so it has to be tied to supports. Port St Johns creeper mixes with Bauhinia galpinii, Plumbago auriculata, and Tecomaria capensis, providing an interesting intermingling of colours. It is not a good cut flower as the flowers drop quite soon after cutting.

This is not generally a pest-ridden plant. You may find tip/twig wilters, also called black stinkbugs or dahlia bugs (Anoplocnemis curvipes), on young shoots, and aphids on the flower buds.

Propagation is by seed, cuttings or layering.

Although a proportion of the seed may be infertile, about 50% should germinate. Seed should be sown in spring or during summer, in a well-drained seedling mix, and need only be covered lightly with the sowing mix, clean coarse sand or milled bark to stop it from blowing away. The trays should be kept moist in a warm but shaded position. Germination should occur in 3-4 weeks and the seedlings potted up after the first pair of true leaves have developed.

Semi-ripe hardwood and/or hardwood cuttings can be taken in spring or during summer. They do not require mist or bottom heat to root, but are best in a covered frame in a well aerated medium e.g. equal parts peat and polystyrene. Rooting period is 6 weeks, with another 6 weeks weaning period.

Podranea ricasoliana can also be propagated by means of layering, or by removing side branches that have rooted by themselves. To encourage Podranea to root by layering, take a low growing stem, lay it along the ground without breaking it off the mother plant, bend the tip to a vertical position, stake it in place and bury or cover the part that is touching the ground with soil. The roots should form at the sharp bend, but inflicting a wound on the lower bent side may also help. Keep the soil moist and remove when a sizeable root ball has developed.",,,,,,,,
Ledebouria petiolata,Ledebouria petiolata,,"Ledebouria petiolata is a robust bulbous plant that reaches heights of 100–350 mm and spreads rapidly, with clumps reaching ± 300 mm in diameter. The actual storage organ is a globose (spherical) bulb made up of fleshy leaf scales that resemble lily scales, white towards the base and dark pink-purple at the top. Bulbs are deciduous in winter-rainfall regions, but can be evergreen in temperate summer rainfall climates. The plants have strikingly spotted leaves, 75–120 mm long and ±45 mm wide, on slender petioles (leaf stalks), often with wavy margins, glossy, mid to dark green, depending on whether it grows indoors or outdoors. Its peduncle (flower stalk) reaches 300 mm tall, bearing a tight cluster of small, scented white flowers, turning pale green on opening. Flowers appear in late winter (August) or early spring (September) and throughout summer ( until March). According to the website http://redlist.sanbi.org checked on 07/10/2015, the conservation status of this plant is Least Concern (LC).","The genus Ledebouria is named after Carl Friedrich van Ledebour (1785-1851) German botanist and professor of botany at Dorpat. The name petiolata means ‘with petioles’, referring to the leaves.

Its old name Drimiopsis means ‘bearing a resemblance to Drimia’, another member of this family, which gets its name from the Greek word drimys meaning acrid, in reference to the roots causing inflammation. The name maculata is derived from the Latin word maculosus meaning ‘spotted’, referring to the purple spots found on the foliage.

This scientific name of this species was changed in 2004 from Drimiopisis maculata to Ledebouria petiolata based on a molecular phylogenetic analysis of the family by Manning, Goldblatt and Fay. The genus Ledebouria now includes all Drimiopsis and Resnova.","Ledebouria petiolata is widespread in eastern South Africa, it occurs in Mpumalanga, Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal and Eastern Cape; and in Swaziland and Mozambique, and extends into tropical East Africa, as far as Tanzania.Not much is known about Ledebouria petiolata pollinators, however it is known to be visited by generalist pollinators such as honey bees.",,"Horticulturally it does well as a container plant, ground cover, filler, and in shady rock gardens.

Ledebouria petiolata is no stranger to windowsills and containers, it makes for a perfect indoor plant and is known as one of the few carefree plants. As long as it is not placed in direct sunlight or allowed to get too hot, it will flourish within any home. Plants should be watered every two to three days, preferably when the medium dries out, and at least once every two weeks with a liquid fertilizer. Feeding and watering will be done more often in summer (December) during its growing season.

This undemanding plant can also be planted outdoors where it will add interest to any dark or shaded garden space. It prefers a shady or semi-shaded area to grow optimally, but can be grown in a sunny spot, preferably morning sun, as it can only take a limited amount of hours in the sun, and the leaves tend to scorch due to exposure to high temperatures. However, the spots are more prominent on plants that are exposed to brighter light. It will withstand light frost but not prolonged exposure to freezing temperatures.

This bulb is not fussy about the medium it grows in, but it would be best if placed in a medium consisting of sand, grit, compost, bark or peat. Ensure that the medium is light, well aerated, has good water retention but is free draining, contains organic matter and is pest/pathogen free. Plant the bulbs with the necks at or just above soil level. Feed regularly with compost placed around bulbs as a mulch; do not smother as they prefer to be slightly emerged.

Propagation by seed will take a few years before you have a sizeable plant. Sow in spring and leave the plants in the trays until they are of a size large enough for pots and transplanting. The best and most common way of propagating, is by division of bulblets or offshoots. These offshoots should be divided every two to three years during the growing season and further grown in containers or directly in the ground in a medium of 60% sand, 20% bark, 10% rotted compost and 10% grit. Another simple, but very effective propagation technique, is by means of leaf scales; remove a leaf scale with a piece of the basal plate intact and place in a propagating medium, such as a 50% polystyrene and 50% fine bark mixture.

The only problematic pests are slugs and snails.",,,"It is known that the bulb scales are traditionally used to wash/cleanse the body,   the water in which pounded bulbs have been steeped is warmed and administered as an enema to children with stomach ailments. In the Eastern Cape, a similar preparation is administered as a purge for new born babies suffering from ipleyti.",,,,,
Adenium multiflorum,Adenium multiflorum,sweetly scented,"Adenium multiflorum is a deciduous succulent shrub or small tree, 0.5-3 m tall, the shape resembling a miniature baobab. Stems arise from a large underground rootstock. The bark is shiny grey to brown, with poisonous watery latex. For most of the year the plants do not have flowers or leaves. The leaves are up to 100 mm long, shiny green above and pale below and usually much broader towards the tip. They are carried in clusters at the growing tips of the branches and are shed before flowering.

The flowers are borne in terminal inflorescences, each flower 50-70 mm in diameter. They vary greatly in colour, usually with pointed white lobes, crinkly red margins and red stripes in the throat. Plants with pure white flowers are occasionally found. The flowers are sweetly scented. Flowering occurs from May to September. The fruit usually consists of paired, cylindrical follicles up to 240 mm long. The seeds are brown with a tuft of silky hairs.

The impala lily is on the Red Data lists of Swaziland, Zambia andZimbabwe where it is regarded as threatened. Most of its range in South Africa falls within the Kruger National Park where it is protected, although it does not have any threatened status in South Africa. The main threats to the species are collection for horticulture, medicinal use, agriculture and browsing by wild animals. Baboons have been seen uprooting whole plants to feed on the tuberous rootstock.","
J.J. Roemer and J.A. Schultes established the genus Adenium in 1819 and up to 12 species have been described. he genus name is derived from the vernacular name for Adenium obesum, namely Oddaeyn, or from Aden, where A. obesum was first collected. J.F. Klotzsch described A. multiflorum in1861 from material collected in Mozambique. The Latin specific epithet refers to the multitude of flowers produced by this plant. In earlier revisions, L.E. Codd considered A. multiflorum as a variety while G.D. Rowley considered it a subspecies of a very closely related but more northerly distributed species, A. obesum. In the latest revision, it was raised to species level again.","The genus Adenium consists of five succulent species from tropical Africa, Arabia and Socotra.

The natural distribution range of Adenium multiflorum extends from southeastern Zambia, through Malawi, Zimbabwe and Mozambique to Limpopo, Mpumalanga and the northern parts of KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa, and Swaziland. These plants are usually found in sandy soil or in alluvium in rocky habitats, in dry woodland or open grassland, on brackish flats. They are found mainly in the frost-free areas of the lowveld and eastern parts of southern Africa, south of the Zambezi River and from sea level to elevations of up to 1 200 m. Although A.multiflorum grows only in the extreme eastern parts of South Africa, it is widely distributed in the central and eastern parts of Africa.
Three other species of Adenium that are found naturally in southern Africa are A. boehmianum, A. oleifolium and A.swazicum. A. boehmianum occurs in the northern parts of Namibia. A swazicum, a much smaller plant that flowers in summer that usually has pinkish flowers, is found in Mpumalanga and Swaziland.A. oleifolium grows in Limpopo, Northern Cape, Namibia and Botswana. All three are cultivated to some extent.

Plants are found in various habitats. Where browsed extensively they tend to be small and shrubby. In protected areas, however, they can become handsome trees. The plant has thick, tuberous undergrounds tems, helping it to survive long periods without water. In nature the plants propagate by means of seed, which is adapted for wind dispersal by having tufts of silky hairs.",,"Their striking forms and beautiful flowers borne in masses over a long period make them excellent garden and container plants.

Adenium multiflorum grows well in warm, well-drained situations where the soil is sandy. In the garden they are not plants for cold or damp areas. They are ideal subjects for a dry rockery, giving a warm colourful display of bright flowers in winter. As container plants they may be kept in cooler places, but do not water them when they are dormant and protect the plants against frost.

Plants grow vigorously from seed, but rarely flower until they are four to five years old. This taxon is seen in cultivation, but is a distant second to A. obesum in availability, mainly because of its slower growth rate and shorter blooming season. At the Shingwedzi Camp in the Kruger National Park some exceptional specimens can be seen.

Water the plants well during hot weather. Keep the potting mix wet in temperatures of 30º C. Plants require high light intensity and temperatures of around 30º C, hot weather preferably accompanied by moderate to high humidity. Plants respond well to regular and generous fertilizing. Add slow-release fertilizer and micronutrients to potting mediums. Inadequate watering and feeding are the primary causes of slow growth in adeniums.

Adeniums must be grown in containers in climates with frost or cool, wet winters. Dormancy can be detected when water consumption declines or when the leaves suddenly turn yellow. Watering should be drastically reduced and stopped when the plants are in full dormancy. Expanding terminal buds signal the end of dormancy and watering can then be increased. Plants need ample root space for rapid growth. The growth of root-bound plants is greatly inhibited and plants should be re-potted until they reach the desired size. The potting mix must provide excellent drainage and aeration. Over-watering and fertilization combined with inadequate light or poor air movement may lead to weak, elongated growth. Adeniums are surprisingly adaptable to cultivation and this adaptatbility includes adjusting their growth cycles to match the reversed seasons in the northern hemisphere (Rowley 1999). Care should be taken to avoid damage to the fleshy, brittle roots when repotting.

Propagation is by seed (the only means in the wild) and vegetative propagation by cuttings or grafting. Larger plants can be obtained from nurseries. Cuttings should preferably be tip-cuttings dipped in a rooting hormone and stuck into a coarse rooting medium and kept well watered. Grafting is also an effective method and more reliable than cuttings. Growing plants from seed is easy and seeds germinate in about a week at 30º C. Treating seeds with a fungicide before sowing reduces loss. Seedlings usually grow through the first winter before obligate dormancy appears.

Adenium multiflorum is susceptible to root rot when watered too frequently during cool weather or if chronically water-logged at any time. The use of a well-drained potting medium will prevent most problems with rotting. Pests rarely damage adeniums grown outdoors .Indoors or in containers, mealy bugs, spider mites, aphids and whiteflies often infest plants. Use pesticides carefully as adeniumsare sensitive to some.","The impala lily is greatly valued for its flowers. A large plant in full bloom is among the most decorative of all succulents, and is highly prized in gardens where the climate allows it to be grown in the open. Adenium multiflorum is planted extensively in the rest camps of the Kruger National Park, for example.",,"The impala lily is known in Africa and southern Africa as a source of fish poison and arrow poison. The poison is prepared from latex in the bark and fleshy parts of the trunk, but it is always used in combination with other poisons. Leaves and flowers are poisonous to goats and cattle, but the plants are sometimes heavily browsed and are not considered to be of much toxicological significance. Despite the toxicity, it is used in medicinal applications and in magic potions.",,,,,
Orbea,Orbea,Unpleasant odour,"Orbeas are leafless, glabrous, succulent perennials that form compact to diffuse clumps. They branch from the base and often arise from rhizomatous rootstocks. The stems) are erect to prostrate and sometimes exhibit a creeping nature. The four-angled stems are usually prominently sharp-toothed, with a soft tip. They usually have well-developed, tooth-like projections (tubercules) on the flanks and are always mottled purplish maroon on a green background, especially distinct when exposed to the sun. At the base of the tubercles a pair of stipular denticles are found and the stems are without any well-developed leaves.

The flowers are 10-100 mm in diameter and are borne in few- to many-flowered inflorescences, appearing together or in quick succession. One to five inflorescences usually develop at any place along a stem. They often have an unpleasant odour, which attracts pollinators. The seed-carrying follicles (fruit) look like two horns, hence the common name bokhoring. Like the stems, they are also smooth, blotched and dotted purple.","The genus Orbea is probably one of the stapeliad genera that has undergone the most taxonomic changes. It was described by Haworth in 1812, and then sunk under Stapelia soon after. Until 1975, when Leach resurrected the genus, most of the species were allocated to either Stapelia or Caralluma.

The name Orbea is derived from the Latin word orbis which refers to the central raised disc or annulus, found in the flowers of most species.","Most of the 15 species of Orbea on the most recent Red Data List for southern Africa are in the category Least Concerned (LC), indicating that they appeared on previous lists and have been deemed as LC in the latest assessments. Orbea elegans is listed as Critically Endangered (CR), O. macloughlinii and O. woodii as Vulnerable (VU) and O. pulchella as Near Threatened (NT).
The genus is distributed widely throughout Africa and enters the Arabian Peninsula. About 56 species are recognized world-wide and are more or less equally divided between the northern and southern hemispheres. Two broad centres are recognized: the north-eastern centre north of the equator and the centre in southern Africa south of the equator. About 28 species are found in southern Africa. Strangely, Orbea is not represented in Madagascar, and in southern Africa it is absent only from Lesotho .Unlike most of the other stapeliad genera in southern Africa, which have their highest degree of diversification on the border between the winter-rainfall area and the dry karroid regions, Orbea has its highest diversification along the eastern escarpment, with a peak in the Soutpansberg and Blouberg areas.The succulent nature of this group enables the plants to go into a dormant state during part of the year, making use of stored food reserves. It is important for growers to establish from which region the plants originally came, i.e. whether they are from summer- or winter-rainfall areas, to know when to stop watering and give the plants the opportunity to go into a rest phase.Orbeas do not have any leaves and the stems, which contain the chlorophyll, perform the process of photosynthesis.The complexity of the flower is narrowly associated with the process of pollination. The genus is florally very diverse and flowers are adapted to a wide range of different fly species that act as pollinators. Many orbeas have vibratile hairs, usually at the edge of the corolla , presumably drawing the attention of flies, which are attracted by the odour of the flowers as well as the movement of the hairs.After pollination, one or two follicles or 'fruit-horns' develop from a flower, with the tightly packed seeds inside. Each seed has a tuft of white hairs (called a coma) on the tip. When the follicles dry out and burst open, these tufts of hair dry and fluff out, ensuring that the seeds become airborne and are dispersed. Young plants are found mostly under small bushes or shrubs, probably because this is where the coma becomes stuck and the seeds are deposited. These microhabitats offer protection for seedlings to survive and establish.",,"All species make attractive ground covers, even when sterile. They can be used to enhance the surrounding areas of larger focal plants. They will definitely attract attention when in full flower, if not for the beautiful flowers then for their odour or the pollinators they may attract to the garden. Most species will do best as container plants if room to spread is allowed; shallow containers usually give the best results. On a patio, hanging baskets can also be used, exposing the stems and clusters of flowers as they grow down the sides.

Species like Orbea gerstneri , O. longidens , O. verrucosa and O. ubomboensis are good ones with which to start. After successfully growing these plants as mother stock in containers, cuttings can be established in a rock garden. Species like O. hardyi and O. conjuncta do well in hanging baskets and shady areas and O. lute, O. melanantha and O. variegata will thrive in the dry garden straight away.

Most species prefer a well-drained, sandy medium consisting of equal parts of washed river sand, potting soil and topsoil. Watering should be adapted according to the natural habitat of the plants. Plants from the wetter regions should be watered more than those that originate from the drier regions. Water rather sparingly than excessively. Plants can survive long periods without water, but be sure to water them before they shrink too much and not able to recover. In nature, most of these plants are naturally sheltered from the hot rays of the sun by the shade of thickets and shrubs, but some can grow in full sun. Plants prefer early morning or late afternoon sun.

Orbeas are easily propagated by stem cuttings, which should be taken during the active growing stage to ensure good rooting, before the plants enter their dormant phase. Cuttings can flower in their first year, depending on the size of the cutting. Seed also germinate easily; be sure to use fresh seed and treat seedlings for damping off. Generally, plants grow fast and most will flower within two to three years when grown from seed.

The most common pests include scale on the stems and mealy bugs on the roots. The latter can cause fungal infections that may devastate plants within days.

When stem rot is seen, the affected parts should be immediately cut away and disposed of and the plant should be placed in quarantine. Various commercial pesticides or environmentally friendly, homemade concoctions can be used to fight pests. The stapeliad snout beetle can also attack plants, consuming the fleshy insides of the stems.",,," a few species are used as food, for example the stems of O. lugardii and O. maculata , which are eaten as a vegetable and taste like lettuce. O. namaquensis is also eaten occasionally, but is very bitter.",,,,,
Pelargonium articulatum,Pelargonium articulatum,,"Pelargonium articulatum is a semi-geophyte, with an underground rhizome that has distinct, alternating thick and thin sections. It has short, aerial stems covered by persistent, large scales, or the leaves can grow directly from the rhizome. The kransmalva can grow up to 500 mm high when in flower and is sometimes deciduous in the hot, summer months. The leaves are simple, hairy and often have a reddish zonal marking. The margins of the 5-palmate leaves are irregularly lobed or toothed. The petiole (leaf stalk) is very long and can be up to 200 mm or longer. The branched inflorescences have 2–5 flowers on each stem. The large 40–50 mm cream-coloured or white flowers, appear in early summer, from October to December. The flowers usually have purple markings on them and orange stamens.

","The genus name is derived from the Greek word pelargos, which means ‘stork’ and refers to the seed that looks similar to the beak of a bird. The species name articulatum, means ‘jointed’ in Latin, and refers to the rhizome that consists of alternating thick and thin sections.

Pelargonium articulatum was first described by Cavanilles in 1787 under the name Geranium articulatum, he based his description on a herbarium specimen from Thunberg. There are about 270 species of Pelargonium, of which 220 species are found in southern Africa.","According to the the Red List of South African Plants, checked on 5 September 2016, the conservation status of Pelargonium articulatum is Least Concern (LC).

Pelargonium articulatum often grows on rocky slopes, in rocky crevices, or in partial shade of other plants and is often overlooked when not in flower. It occurs from Steinkopf to Fraserburg in the Northern Cape, southwards to Worcester in the Western Cape. It grows in the Succulent Karoo or dry fynbos, on shale, dolerite and tillite soils The leaves of Pelargonium articulatum are very hairy, that is an adaptation used to reflect sunlight and reduce air movement around the leaf, both of which reduces water loss. In the hot summer months, the plant can also go dormant, which allows it to survive the hot, dry periods. It is most probably pollinated by bees and other insects. It has poor grazing potential, but it can be grazed to some degree.",,"Pelargonium articulatum is ideal for semi-arid, or water-wise gardens beneath other shrubs. It can also be grown in pots and rockeries. It can be planted with other pelargoniums such as the Pelargonium karooicum (karoomalva ), or succlents such as Euphorbia mauritanica.

Pelargonium articulatum can easily be grown from seeds, or less often by taking cuttings of the underground rhizome, or the short aerial stem. It is more difficult to grow than most pelargoniums in cultivation, since it goes dormant during the hot summer months, but still needs to be watered sparingly during this period. Sow the seeds in summer or autumn (December to May) in a sandy medium. Keep the medium moist and the seeds should germinate in 2 weeks. Seedlings can be transplanted when they are strong enough. Take cuttings in autumn and place them in a sandy loam medium and keep moist until the cutting has rooted.",,,Pelargonium articulatum has been used as a pollen parent plant and can hybridize with zonal pelargoniums.,,,,,
Wart fern ,Microsorum,,Wart fern species have short or widely creeping rhizomes that are often enveloped in a felt of roots. Scales occurring on the rhizome are mostly latticed. The fronds are sessile or stalked and articulated to short phyllopodia which are variably spaced along the rhizome. The frond lamina (leaf blade) can either be simple or pinnatifid and has reticulate venation. The sori (clusters of sporangia) are irregularly scattered on the abaxial surface (undersurface) of the lamina or they occur in one or two rows on either side of the costa (midvein). The sori are not covered by an indusium (covering membrane).,"Microsorum is derived from the Greek word mikrós meaning small, and sorus referring to the small sori occurring in M. punctatum, the type species of the genus.","The approximately 50 Microsorum species are widespread in the temperate and tropical parts of the Old World, extending from the Pacific Islands to north-east Australia, Malaysia, south-east Asia, southern China, the Indian sub-continent and extending to Madagascar and tropical Africa. The highest species diversity occurs in East Asia.

In Africa, the genus, represented by only three species, extends from tropical West Africa to tropical East Africa and southwards to Port St Johns on the east coast of South Africa and occurs from near sea level to about 1 900 m in tropical Africa.

In South Africa wart ferns occur mostly in upland temperate or tropical evergreen or coastal forests, ranging from near sea level to approximately 750 m. The region experiences a seasonal rainfall of more than 1 000 mm per annum. Microsorum scolopendria occurs terrestrially in dune forests and coastal scrub, whereas M. pappei and M. punctatum grow as lithophytes or epiphytes in evergreen forests, mostly in deep shade.",,"The Polypodiaceae is a large and very diverse fern family with a cosmopolitan distribution. However, most species belonging to the family have a tropical distribution. The family consists of about 540 species classified into 30 genera. Although some species are terrestrial, many are restricted to a lithophytic or epiphytic habit. Many species from this family are widely cultivated either as house plants or as garden subjects.

Microsorum punctatum and M. scolopendria are widely cultivated as garden or indoor plants. Several species are also used for medicinal purposes.

Although most plants can tolerate a wide range of growing conditions, it is not recommended that any of the three South African species be considered for areas where severe frosts regularly occur or where humidity is consistently very low.",,,,,,,,

The species Echium plantagineum (bloudissel) introduced from Europe, is locally frequent in disturbed areas and colour many fallow agricultural fields blue in the Boland when flowering in spring. In England this species is known as viper's bugloss and in Australia where it is also a serious weed, Paterson 's curse. J.G.C. Lehmann established the genus in 1830 to separate it from Echium, placing emphasis on the presence of so-called staminal scales in Lobostemon.","A number of species are viewed to be threatened, e.g. Lobostemon belliformis known only from about 30 individuals growing in one locality near Gouritz. The main threat appears to be the destruction of natural habitat due to agricultural activities.

Twenty-eight species are endemic to South Africa, largely confined to the winter rainfall area from Springbok to Mossel Bay, and further eastward along the coast to about Grahamstown, where rain occurs throughout the year. Plants resprout especially after fire and are mostly insect-pollinated, with the red-flowered species bird-pollinated.

",,,,,"Lobostemon fruticosus, known to most rural folk in the Western Province, is used especially for treating wounds, blood poisoning, ringworms, skin diseases and syphilis.

It provides seasonal colour and can be grown in a sunny position in the garden or even in semi-shade. It serves as an excellent filler plant, and can be used in an herbaceous border or even as a pot plant, as it is a low-growing shrub.

These plants are easily grown from seed sown in autumn or even from stem cuttings. Stem cuttings can be taken from the plant once flowering has finished and while the plant is actively growing in early spring. Cuttings can be placed in a mix of sifted bark, coir and perlite. With the help of a rooting hormone, the cuttings can root within 2 weeks under mist irrigation.

Once well rooted, remove the cuttings from the propagation unit and allow them to harden off for a week in a semi-shaded area and, depending on the soil moisture, water them once or twice a day. Pot them up into a medium made up of equal parts sand, bark and compost. Once the plants are well rooted and large enough, plant them into the garden.

If grown from seed, sow seed in March, in a mix made up of equal parts sand, compost and bark; and water regularly with a gentle spray. The seeds germinate in 1–3 weeks. When large enough, plant the seedlings 15–30 cm apart in the garden.",,,,,,,,
Gladiolus longicollis,Gladiolus longicollis,"strong sweet fragrance

","An attractive, perennial herb, 350–600 mm tall, that is semi-hardy in temperate climates. They grow from rounded, symmetrical corms that are enveloped in several layers of coarse, brownish, fibrous tunics. Leaves 3, only the lowermost with a well-developed blade, about two-thirds as long as the stem.

Flowers in 1-3-flowered spikes, are variously coloured, creamy yellow to white, pink to reddish or light purple with white, contrasting markings, or orange to red. They have a flower tube, 35–110130 mm long, that has nectar at its base. It is known as a grassland plant on the slopes of the Drakensberg, where it is usually tossed about by the wind, and with its flowers furled for most of the day, it is not easy to photograph. ","The genus Gladiolus is derived from the Latin gladius, the diminutive of ‘a sword’, referring to the shape of the leaves. This species is named for its long flower tubes, from the Latin longus, meaning ‘long’ or ‘extended’ and collis, ‘hill’ or ‘mound’, but also ‘neck’ or ‘throat’. Gladiolus is a genus of perennial, cormous flowering plants in the iris family (Iridaceae). Sometimes called the sword lily, the most widely used English common name for these plants is simply gladiolus (plural gladioli, gladioluses or sometimes gladiolas).","Gladiolus longicollis grows in the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal, and a little into the Free State and the Western Cape. It also occurs in Lesotho. It occurs in grassland, its predominant habitat, usually in low, open grassland.",,"It can be cultivated from corms as well as seeds. It should preferably be planted in light, well-drained, sandy loam soil in full sun. As this is a summer-growing species, plant corms in spring (around September) and give plenty of water all through the growing season. Corms are best planted in open ground, rather than pots, roughly 10 cm deep and 15 cm apart. Avoid the use of inorganic fertilizers, especially those with high nitrogen content. Rather use organic compost or bone meal. The corms can be left in the soil during the winter dormancy period, or lifted and stored in a cool airy place to prevent decay.

When growing from seed, sow in September. Use a well-drained, sterile sowing medium, sow the seeds thinly and cover lightly. The seeds generally germinate well and seedlings appear after 2 to 4 weeks. Water thoroughly all through the growing season. However, flowers will only be produced from the second season onwards.",,,"Many African herbalists consider gladioli to be magical medicinal plants, as they are used for the treatment of diarrhoea, colds, dysentery, constipation and also as a booster for patients with low energy levels.",,,,,
"Gethyllis
","Gethyllis
",,"Gethyllis, like most other plants adapted to temperate climates, is deciduous. Nourished by long, fleshy roots, the bulbs store sufficient reserves to survive the long, dry season in a dormant state but when conditions become favourable they produce leaves.

Most species have a basal cluster of numerous, narrow, frequently spiralled leaves, whereas a few have only 1 or 2 leaves, which are broad and held flat on the ground. Several species are easily recognized by a prominent sheath that extends above ground and holds the leaves in a tight cluster. The sheaths themselves are often attractively ornamented with handsome reddish brown spots (e.g. G. britteniana) or they are elaborately fringed, as in G. verticillata. Unlike most Amaryllidaceae, the leaves of Gethyllis are often hairy. The hairs are simple and evenly spaced or T-shaped and clustered together, which adds to the density of the covering.

Gethyllis differs from most of its relatives by having just one flower per bulb each season. Each flower has 6 tepals, which join to form a long floral tube that leads down to a subterranean ovary. The flowers vary from white to cream or pink and the tepals are often boldly striped with dark pink. Generally they are sweetly and strongly scented. Equally attractive are the prominent, bright yellow anthers, which help to distinguish groups of species. For instance, G. ciliaris and its relatives may have as many as 30 anthers per flower, whereas G. verticillata and its allies only have 6 anthers per flower as is typical of most Amaryllidaceae. Although initially long and straight, the anthers eventually curl up, becoming less conspicuous with age. The style is noticeably variable in its length and position. It is straight and stout, terminating in a small, undifferentiated stigma, or slender and curved with a conspicuous, broad stigma at its tip.

The berry-like, finger-length fruits are borne close to the ground and are variously shaped, coloured and fragrant when ripe. Best known are the fleshy, yellow to pink fruits which smell somewhat of strawberries. Less conspicuous are the slender, thin-textured fruits that remain pale-coloured, sometimes spotted, and odourless. When ripe, the fruit walls disintegrate and release numerous, roundish, cream-coloured to reddish seeds. The basic chromosome number for the genus is x = 6.","The name Gethyllis is thought to come from the Greek gethyon, which means a bulb, onion or species of leek. The apparent likeness to a leak is due to the bulbs' long, white sheathing tunics that surround the base of the leaves, rather than to the plants' culinary properties.","Gethyllis has 32 recognized species, 30 of which are found in the summer-arid areas of southern Africa. Only G. transkarooica and G. longistyla are found in the summer-rainfall region's Nama Karoo Biome. The greatest number of species occurs in the Succulent Karoo Biome, followed by the Fynbos Biome. Habitats range from coastal forelands to South Africa's high-lying, inland plateau. In most instances the plants prefer open sites, free of competition from shrubs and grasses. The majority of species favours semi-arid habitats but a few Cape species (G. afra and G. kaapensis) are localized in seasonally moist sites amongst lowland fynbos vegetation. To cope with their dry environments these plants have developed a remarkably novel lifestyle. They flower fleetingly in midsummer, fruit in autumn, and have leaves in winter, a period when they are most likely to be seen before conditions dry out at the end of spring. Studies suggest that the fleshy seeds evolved early in the group's history and greatly influenced the group's evolution when conditions in southern Africa became more arid several million years ago.

The seeds germinate immediately once released, but for the seedlings to survive, they depend on adequate and timely rainfall. In the western and northwestern Cape, the optimal time for seed release is autumn. The large, many-seeded fruits are slow to mature, so flowering is bound to take place several months earlier, in midsummer. To cope with the dry summer conditions, flowering lasts two or three days and is synchronous. In addition, the ovary, which later becomes the fruit, remains cool and protected below ground, where it continues to ripen for several months.

",,"As the bulbs die easily if over-watered, the cultivation of Gethyllis is best left to a bulb specialist and their use in gardens should be avoided. The bulbs grow best in deep containers in a well-drained medium. Water should be applied with restraint in winter but stopped as soon as the leaves begin to wither in spring, when the pots should be moved to a cool, dry place.",,,"The fruits are much sought after for their fragrance and purported medicinal properties. In the past the dried fruits were often used to scent handkerchiefs and linen cupboards. A dilute infusion of the flowers of G. spiralis was used to ease teething troubles and its skin was applied to boils, bruises and insect bites. Today the edible fruits of G. afra are still used to make kukumakranka brandy, a popular remedy for colic and indigestion",,,,,
Samolus porosus,Samolus porosus,,"Samolus porosus is a tufted herbaceous perennial attaining an average height between 300 and 600 mm. It has stiff, erect stems that arise in tufts from horizontal rhizomes. Its stems are sparsely branched, ribbed, rough with little raised dots and slightly woody at the base.

The leaves are produced as a flat whorl at the base of the plant and there are smaller leaves arranged up the stem, often dying when the flowering stem is produced.

Its attractive flowers are small and white to pale pink, produced in racemes or panicles from November through to February.","Samolus = a genus of about a dozen species of water loving herbs found almost anywhere in the world, commonly called brook weed or water pimpernel. The source of the name is unclear. The specific epithet porosus has its derivation from the Greek word poros, a passage or pore, and therefore porosus means having minute interstices or openings through which water and air may pass.

","Samolus porosus is a water loving plant found in moist or in permanently wet places in coastal marshes, seeps and cliffs from Namaqualand to KwaZulu-Natal.

Samolus porosus grows in clay and loamy soils in full sun, lightly shaded areas and even heavier shade. It is often found colonizing the edges of estuaries even where the water is subject to tidal influences and is therefore brackish. It may form dense colonies, and with its vigorous rhizomatous growth helps to stabilize water edges, thereby helping to reduce erosion.

It is also common on south-facing cliffs along the southern Western Cape coast where it latches onto mud flows or colonizes peaty crevices. In this environment it often grows as a single plant or as individuals scattered across the cliffs where it can find suitable purchase. These environments are shaded and only receive short periods of direct sunlight, particularly in summer. Samolus porosus, in this environment, grows softer reaching for better light, and although initially erect, its etiolated stems often cascade from the cliffs.

Samolus porosus grows wherever there is permanent seep and has the habit of colonizing erosion or drainage ditches where water accumulates. It may be found in such ditches along forest margins where it produces an abundance of soft, tangled and cascading branches. When these plants are flowering they look very similar to Gypsophila paniculata , the florist plant commonly known as baby's-breath.",,"Samolus will grow well in any position in sun or partial shade as long as it is well watered. It will be a very useful plant for bog gardens, coastal gardens, stream edges or even a well watered pot in semishade where it can cascade over the edge of the pot and give a good display when flowering.

The quick and easy way to propagate this plant is by division. Clumps can be dug up and split or cut into smaller sections and planted straight into soil and kept moist.

Samolus porosus, however, produces copious amounts of seed in summer. Each flower produces a small capsule that releases very fine seed in January or February. This seed should be sown fresh within the first year to ensure good germination. At Kirstenbosch we took the extra precaution of smoking the seed with good results. Young seedlings are pricked out into individual plugs or pots and fed regularly with an organic fertilizer. At Kirstenbosch we have only recently worked with this plant and are still experimenting with suitable soil mixes. Early indications are that it is adaptable to most soils as long as it is regularly watered.",,,,,,,,
Dicliptera cernua,Dicliptera cernua,,"Low-growing, herbaceous, perennial groundcover or shrublet, slightly hairy, sprawling and rambling, up to 500 mm high and spreads indefinitely. Leaves are in an opposite arrangement and ovate (egg-shaped). Small bilabiate (two lipped) magenta flowers are sporadically borne in an axillary cyme in winter, from March to September. Inflorescence is bibracteate, i.e. has two floral bracts, which are small and sepal-like. Seed capsules do not dehisce elastically. Fast growing once established and long lived for an herbaceous perennial.","The genus name Dicliptera is derived from the Greek di-, meaning ‘two’, kleio, ‘to shut’ and pteros ‘winged’, referring to the two placentas that rise elastically in fruit. Its old name Peristrophe is also derived from Greek: peri meaning ‘around’ and strophos ‘a twisted band or belt’, referring to the bracts that surround and enclose the calyx. The species name cernua means nodding, from the Latin cernuus falling headlong or face down, inclined, stooping or bowing forwards. Due to varying naming characteristics of the genera and the need for comparison for both African and southern African Peristrophe and Dicliptera, various botanical authors, such as Ensermu (2003) and Darbyshire & Vollesen (2007) have concluded that the two should be combined. The southern African flora adopted the revision by Kevin Balkwill done in 1996, as the current state of revision and as such, Peristrophe is now a synonym of Dicliptera as adopted by J.C. Manning and P. Goldblatt for the 2012 publication of Cape plants. Dicliptera cernua was first described by Christian G.D Nees von Esenbeck (1776–1858), who was a German botanist and naturalist.","Dicliptera cernua is endemic to South Africa and found in warm and tropical areas of the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal. It can be found in Valley Bushveld from the Gamtoos River to KwaZulu-Natal. Dicliptera has approximately 170 species in the genera and is very diverse. Some of the Acanthaceae genera are closely associated and in particular Dyschoriste, Peristrophe and Hypoestes. The three genera currently form a subtribe, Diclipterinae. They are only distinguished from each other by single characteristics, and the inflorescences are similar. Hypoestes has monothecous anthers (consisting of a single cell) while the other two genera have bithecous anthers (two cells). Hypoestes shares the common characteristic of non-elasticated capsule dehiscence with Peristrophe, whereas Dicliptera has an elastic dehiscence. The latter characteristic requires mature fruits or transverse sections of the ovary for correct identification between Peristrophe and Dicliptera, and, therefore, makes identification difficult if this is not available.",,"There is potential for Dicliptera cernua to be used in large scale landscapes as a low maintenance groundcover and soil stabilizer. Currently it is not widely used. The vigorous habit of the form available in the ornamental horticultural trade, makes it unsuitable for very small-scale gardening, as it readily overgrows other less vigorous plants if not regularly trimmed back. However, it does lend itself towards growing in large areas that need cover, including those areas that are difficult to garden, such as in partial day sun or shade areas next to buildings or as a full groundcover under standards. It makes a wonderful companion to large trees that need a groundcover surrounding their base, as the plant seems to cope readily with the root competition if regularly watered. Its growth is easily kept under control by trimming back the sides and rarely needs to be topped. It will tolerate light shade to full sun and grows as vigorously in either condition.

The false buck-weed is easily grown from tip or stem cuttings taken at any time of the year, and is easily rooted using the most basic of propagation methods. If the planting is established, rooted runners or even sods of overgrown plant material can be cut back and replanted.

Dicliptera cernua tolerates a range of growth environments and soil types. It prefers a well-drained soil that is watered regularly. It will spread rapidly and flower in shade to full sun conditions, although it is grown more for its dense foliage than a prolific show of flowers. Flowering performance is not impacted by lighting conditions. Growth habit is slightly less dense in dark shade. It is water wise, but not fully drought tolerant. General garden fertilizing can be used to maintain plant health and growth vigor.",,,,,,,,
Salvia lanceolata,Salvia lanceolata,,"Salvia lanceolata is a relatively quick-growing, upright shrub, reaching up to 2 m. Stems are herbaceous becoming woody and, like all members of this family, are square-shaped. Leaves are aromatic, opposite, narrowly paddle-shaped, grey-green and lightly hairy.

Flowers are mostly in pairs in short spikes, clustered at the tips of branches, a dull rose-red to rusty crimson or greyish blue, 25-35 mm long with the upper lip 17 mm long. The shape of the flower is typical of the sage family, with a two-lipped corolla, the upper lip hooded and the lower lip turned down at the edge, giving the impression of a gaping mouth. The filaments of the stamens are hinged, which gives them mobility, allowing them to attach pollen to visiting pollinators. It has a long flowering period, flowers occurring from spring (September) throughout summer and autumn to early winter (June).

The calyx is funnel-shaped, also two-lipped, and is dotted with glands and short hairs. The calyx is persistent, meaning that it remains on the plant after the corolla has been shed. This adds vastly to the attractiveness of the plant, because the calyx turns a deeper shade of red than the corolla and it enlarges while the seeds are developing, becoming papery thin and very attractive-every bit as showy as the flowers. Four small, round, light brown, nut-like seeds are formed inside the calyx, turning dark brown when mature and simply dropping out when dry and ripe. However, in Salvia lanceolata, the lower lip does not form a platform but bends downwards and backwards, and the flower is more elongated and tube-like, and the long, hooded upper lip places the anthers and stigma further from the entrance to the flower than the length of a bee. All this and its reddish colour indicate that this salvia is pollinated by birds. The hinge mechanism of the stamens still works, but in this case it is the bird's beak that pushes against the hinged filament while probing for nectar, causing the stamens to move down and deposit the pollen on the head of the bird. In their study, Wester & Claßen-Bockhoff (2007) observed the Lesser Double Collared Sunbird Nectarinia chalybea, and the Cape White-eye Zosterops pallidus visiting Salvia lanceolata flowers at Kirstenbosch NBG.","Salvia is derived from the Latin, salvus, meaning safe or well or sound, (verb salvere, to be in good health), referring to the healing properties of the plant. The species name, lanceolata, is also Latin and means lance- or spear-shaped, referring to the shape of the leaves.","Salvia lanceolata commonly occurs in fynbos on coastal sands and limestone and on rocky outcrops or hillsides in the Western Cape and Northern Cape, from the Cape Peninsula and Montagu to Namaqualand. The genus Salvia consists of ± 900 species widely distributed in the warm temperate and tropical regions of the world. There are 27 species found naturally in South Africa, and one European and three tropical American species that have naturalized here. Some other noteworthy South African sages are Salvia africana-lutea (golden sage/ bruinsalie ), S. africana-caerulea (blue sage), S. chamelaeagnea (rough blue sage), S. muirii and S. thermarum (Goudini sage) to mention only a few. Many species of sage are grown as ornamentals. Salvia officinalis, from the Mediterranean, is the commonly used culinary herb, sage.",,"This plant is easy to grow and fuss-free. It needs full sun and well-drained soil, do not over water once established as it is really water-wise. Although naturally rounded, a little pruning will keep the plant neat and bushy, and prevent it from becoming too woody. Feed with regular applications of compost/mulch. Salvias do well in most areas of South Africa, adapting well to local conditions as they are so hardy. They will also tolerate frost as they are capable of resprouting from the base as a mechanism to recover from fynbos fires, so similarly they will be able to recover suitably from frost damage.

Salvia lanceolata is suitable as a specimen plant or used in an informal shrub border. It does well in containers and in rockeries, on verges or on slopes. It is perfect for fynbos gardens, coastal gardens and water-wise gardens, and is an interesting addition to the herb garden.

Propagate by seed or cuttings. Sow seed in autumn or spring, use a suitable well-drained medium. Germination is quick and seedlings can be potted up as soon as the first pair of true leaves has formed. Stem cuttings should be taken in spring, from new growth that is just firming up into semi-hardwood. Use rooting hormone and a mist unit with bottom heat to ensure a higher success rate.",,,"Most sages contain essential oils and have long been used for food flavouring and medicine all over the world. The southern African species are widely used in traditional medicine to treat chest complaints, stomach complaints and digestive disturbances, women's ailments, fever, and as disinfectant antiseptic washes and lotions for skin infections and wounds.

Gerbera viridifolia,Gerbera viridifolia,,"It is a stemless perennial herb, with numerous brown, thong-like roots and leaves emerging from the silky crown. The leaves are very variable, usually stalked, the upper surface is hairy at first, becoming smooth, and the lower surface is never densely hairy. The inflorescence stalks are up to 45 cm long, smooth at the base becoming hairy towards the apex, sometimes with glandular hairs ending in a small knob. The flower heads are solitary, with an outer series of long female ray-florets usually white inside and reddish or purplish on the margins and outside (in the northern areas), and often mauve or purplish in the Mpumalanga and KZN regions.

The central florets are numerous, functionally male, with whitish or purplish corollas. The fruit (known as a cypsela) is about 6 mm. long, somewhat flattened, and the pappus (the hairy parachute-like appendage) is dark purple or cream. Flowering occurs mostly in the Spring (September to November), but sporadic flowering may be observed throughout the year.","The genus Gerbera was named by Jan Gronovius in 1737 for the Gerber brothers: Fr. Gerber, who collected plants in the West Indies, and Traugott Gerber, a German medical doctor baptised in 1710, and the curator of the oldest botanical garden in Moscow. In spite of extensive investigations, no link or reason has been found for the choice of their name for the genus (Ambrosius 2003).The specific epithet 'viridifolia', means 'with green leaves', possibly referring to the lack of white felting on the lower leaf surface, which is often found in the closely related G. ambigua. Gerbera viridifolia is one of the parents of the commercially produced Gerbera hybrids, one of the top-selling cut flowers and pot plants in the world. The breeding of Gerbera started at the end of the 19th century in Cambridge, England, when Richard Lynch crossed G. jamesonii and G. viridifolia. Most of the current commercially grown varieties originate from this cross.","Gerbera viridifolia is widespread, particularly in the KwaZulu-Natal, Mpumalanga and Swaziland regions. The species is found in grasslands, in stony soil, on mountain slopes and even in damp areas throughout the eastern regions of Africa. It species is common and widespread in areas of moderate to high rainfall This species is widespread and very variable, and a number of previously recognized separate species have been 'sunk' into it (G. burchellii, G. glandulosa, G. plantaginea, G. speciosa).

Of these, 6 species are confined to the Cape.",,"This species is a very rewarding horticultural subject. It grows easily from seed or from divisions. Fresh seed should be sown in a seedling mix and kept moist. Germination occurs within about two weeks, and seedlings can be pricked out at the four-leaf stage. Once planted out into a well composted sunny area, plants require little attention, and should receive little or no watering in winter. They should be placed towards the front of a bed because the flowerheads are borne on stalks of about 50 cm length. They are good subjects for grassland gardens and rockeries.

The purple forms are especially attractive because a range of colours from very pale lilac to deep mauve is often found in the same seed collection.",,,"This is one of the species is referred to in the eastern Cape as ‘Iyeza lamazi” or ‘the herb of milk’ and is probably used to stimulate milk production in cattle or as an ingredient of maas (the locally produced soured milk) (Dold et al 2002).

",,"Pelargonium fulgidum is a perennial dwarf shrub with a scrambling habit. It is 0.4-1.0 m high but if growing amongst, and supported by other plants, it can reach a height of 2 m or more. The stems are semisucculent, becoming woody with age, and are covered with persistent membranous stipules.

The leaves are oblong to heart-shaped, with serrated margins and are covered with tiny, silvery hairs, making them silky. The leaves are 30-100 x 20-70 mm, and are pinnately incised into 3-6 lobes (meaning that they are cleft nearly to the midrib but are not separated into distinct leaflets). The petioles are 20-90 mm long and covered with long, soft hairs. Fused to the base of the petioles, are the large, asymmetrical, ovate, membranous stipules.

The flowers are scarlet or carmine and are borne above the foliage on a long, branched peduncle, in 4-9-flowered, umbel-like heads. Flowering occurs from winter to early summer (June to November).","Pelargonium is derived from pelargos (Greek), meaning stork, referring to the shape of the fruit, which resembles the beak of a stork.The Latin species name f ulgidum means shining or bright coloured, and refers to the brilliantly coloured flowers. Linnaeus (1753) originally described Pelargonium fulgidum as Geranium fulgidum. Its history dates back to the early days of colonization at the Cape.In the early 18th century, this species was introduced to Holland and distributed to the garden of Pisa in Italy and the Sherard Garden near London.It is one of the few species of Pelargonium with bright red flowers and is the parent of a number of beautiful hybrids.","Pelargonium fulgidum grows on exposed, windswept granite outcrops or on sand hills, near the coast. The species is confined mostly to the western coastal districts. It occurs from the Orange River through the Namaqualand Klipkoppe and the Knersvlakte of Namaqualand, to Yzerfontein in the Western Cape. The genus Pelargonium includes roughly 200 natural species and many artificial hybrids. Most of the natural species are indigenous to South Africa but there are a few species occurring in tropical Africa, Syria,Australia and on a few islands in the Indian Ocean.",,"Pelargonium fulgidum grows in the winter rainfall region of southern Africa in full sun and well-drained sandy soil.

This pelargonium will suit water-wise, coastal gardens, in the winter rainfall region and will do perfectly in a rockery or as a potplant. It may not do as well in the summer rainfall region as it may receive too much water during its dormant phase.

Pelagonium fulgidum can be propagated by taking cuttings during the autumn months (April or May); when the plant comes into leaf. Once the cutting is taken, allow it to dry out for a day or two. To enhance rooting success, use a rooting hormone powder. Place the cuttings in a tray filled with river sand and place the tray in a cold frame or in a cool, slightly shaded area. Keep the tray damp but not wet. The cuttings will root in four weeks or more.

Once the cuttings have rooted, pot them into a well-drained, sandy medium and place them in a sunny area. Water them every third day. When they have formed a strong root-ball, plant them in the garden.",,,,,,,,
Carissa bispinosa,Carissa bispinosa,,"This species is only occasionally tree-like (up to 5 m) and is more often a dense bush or rambling shrub in wooded spots or scrub.

Leaves are opposite, simple, shortly petiolate, ovate, broadly ovate or ovate-elliptic, with a smooth margin, glossy dark green above, paler below, with short, thorn-like tips (heart-shaped tapering to a sharp point).

Flowers are small, white or tinged pink, with a long, slender corolla tube, sweetly scented and clustered at the tips of twigs. Fruit are small, ovoid, edible, red berries. The whole fruit, including the seed, is edible and although the skin is slightly milky, it has a delicious flavour. It is not uncommon to find fruit and flowers on the same plant.","The name Carissa is derived from the Indian name for plants of this genus, which contain a bitter and poisonous glucoside in the bark called carrisin. The epithet bispinosa is derived from a Latin word that means two-spined, referring to the forked spines of the plants.

Flowering is from winter to early summer.","The species is named after Austrian Franz Andreas Bauer (1758–1840), who was the botanical artist to King George 111 of England. Sir Joseph Banks persuaded Bauer to take up a position at the Royal Botanical Gardens Kew, where he served as royal draftsman for 50 years. The subspecific name refers to the area called ‘Gouriqua’ where this subspecies is found.","Erica baueri subsp. gouriquae is classified as EN (Endangered), indicating that the species is facing a very high risk of extinction. It occurs at two-known locations where it is declining due to habitat loss to expanding crop cultivation and competition from alien invasive plants, predominantly wattles and pines. These were cleared before 2005, but there are still quite a lot of aliens present at the site, requiring ongoing management and clearing.

Erica baueri subsp. gouriquae appears to be endemic to Canca Limestone Fynbos which is found between Albertinia and Still Bay where it has a very limited distribution of about 55 km². It was previously known from a single location in a private nature reserve west of Gouritsmond, where it was recorded to be locally frequent. In 2007, the population size was estimated to be fewer than 500 mature individuals.

On a recent visit to the site in 2012, only two mature individuals could be found, but the site had recently burnt and it may still be regenerating. In 2007, a plant belonging to this subspecies was collected north of Still Bay, significantly extending the known range of this taxon, and raising the possibility that it may be more widespread within Canca Limestone Fynbos than previously thought. More surveys are needed to determine the extent of the population.It grows in sandy areas associated with limestone, between the hills to the south of Albertinia near the coast, an area called Gouriqua. It is possible that the soils are not alkaline as this species thrives in acidic soils in cultivation. The climate is Mediterranean with winter rain and hot, windy and dry summers. Its tubular flowers attract sunbirds who are the main pollinating agent. Plants are killed by fire and regenerate from seed.",,"Erica baueri subsp. gouriquae is an excellent garden plant flowering over many months and is a good cut flower. It also makes a wonderful container plant.

This erica grows in deep, well-drained, sandy soils, but is adaptable and will grow in a range of soil types. It will also grow in heavier clay soils if there is good drainage and it must be watered less often to allow the medium to dry out between watering. The ideal soil pH is between 5.5 and 6.7, but the soils may range from acidic to neutral.

The Gouriqua heath is easily grown from seed, which should preferably be sown in autumn in the Western Cape. In other regions it should probably be germinated at the beginning of the growing season. Treatment with smoke or smoke extract greatly enhances germination. The seed takes about six to ten weeks to germinate and are delicate in their early stages. It is important not to sow too thickly as seedlings growing too close together and overwatering may result in damping off. The young seedlings should be protected from heavy rainfall and direct sunlight by placing the trays under cover, while still providing good light and aeration. The seedlings should be watered gently to avoid washing them out of the tray or flattening their young delicate stems. Allow the young plants to grow to about 10 mm tall before planting them out into multi-trays or small pots/bags. Plants should be grown up to at least 10 cm before planting out in the garden.

Propagation from cuttings is more difficult and should be done with suitable facilities, such as mist propagation houses with heated benches and overhead misting. Cuttings are preferably taken in autumn in the winter-rainfall Western Cape, but may be taken in spring or early summer as well. Take fresh, actively growing, thin side shoots taken as heel cuttings, that yield the best results. A rooting hormone for semi-hardwood cuttings applied to the cut surface or heel, results in quicker and better rooting. Rooting may take from eight to sixteen weeks and sometimes longer. If the stem tip develops a callous, but not roots, then score the callus and apply more hormone and place in fresh rooting medium. This often results in very good rooting.

Erica baueri subsp. gouriquae is a resilient species that should be suitable for most gardens in South Africa where the humidity is not too high or where there is little or no frost. They also do well in coastal gardens, as long as the soils are acidic and it is not exposed to too harsh salt-laden wind. It grows well in various garden aspects, including open beds, rockeries and on slopes.

Feed before flowering with slow release 3:1:5, or monthly with a good organic seaweed-derived fertilizer. Be careful not to disturb the roots and water regularly as this is generally the cause of losses with ericas. Good results have also been achieved when applying controlled release fertilisers suitable for erica. Be careful not to exceed dosage.

Pruning will increase flower production resulting in splendid displays and increase the life expectancy of the plants. Ericas are relatively short-lived fynbos plants and survive on average up to between 10 and 15 years, after which they need to be replaced.

It is a prolific flowerer and is a wonderful addition to the garden and for attracting sunbirds.",,,,,,,,
"Watsonia borbonica
","Watsonia borbonica
",,"Watsonia borbonica is a tender to half-hardy herbaceous perennial that grows up to 2 m high. It is deciduous, growing during autumn-winter-spring and dying back after flowering in spring to early summer and remaining dormant during summer. The rootstock is a corm, 30-40 mm in diameter with grey-brown tunics. It bears upright fans of 5-6, up to 8 glossy, broad, sword-shaped leaves, 20-40 mm wide, that are one to two thirds as long as the flower spike. The margins of the leaves are without colour (hyaline) and moderately thickened.

The flowering stem usually bears two or more small bracts in the upper part, is usually branched and reaches up to 2 m in height. The flower is a spike, the main axis bearing up to 20 flowers and the branching (lateral) spikes up to 10 flowers. The flowers are large and showy, pale to deep pink to light purple, and faintly fragrant. The tepals have a darker midline, and a white streak at the base and very occasionally a plant is found where the whole tepal is white.

The flowers are zygomorphic, i.e. they can be divided into equal halves in one plane only. Flowering time is during late spring to early summer-from October to early December and sometimes into January. The fruit is an oblong capsule, more or less woody, sometimes widening at the apex, splitting to release winged seeds, 8-12 x 2.5 mm.","The genus Watsonia was named by Philip Miller of Chelsea after his friend Sir William Watson (1715-1787), a London physician and naturalist. The species name borbonica means from the Ile de Bourbon, now Réunion, as it was mistakenly thought to originate from Réunion. In Australia and the USA, W. borbonica has become naturalized in some areas and is known as the Cape bugle lily or rosy watsonia.

The Afrikaans common name kanol is a phonetically corrupted version of the original Dutch word knol, meaning a corm, and is applied to many cormous species, although mainly to species of Watsonia. It is often accompanied by a descriptive prefix e.g. rooikanol (red corm) if the flowers are red or in this case, suurkanol, because the corm is sour-tasting. The name is also often combined with pypie as in kanolpypie, pypie being the Afrikaans name for a miniature long-stemmed pipe which the tubular flowers resemble. Being a very conspicuous species, the early botanists visiting the Cape couldn't help but notice it. The first recorded collections were made by Anders Sparrman and Carl Thunberg in the 1770s.","Watsonia borbonica grows in the extreme southwest of the Western Cape, from Tulbagh southwards to the Cape Peninsula and eastwards to Bredasdorp. Its habitat is mainly rocky sandstone slopes or well-drained slopes of clay and granite, and sometimes in deep sandy soil at the foot of the mountains. Watsonia borbonica is divided into two subspecies: W. borbonica subsp. borbonica and W. borbonica subsp. ardernei. The subsp. borbonica has stamens that are bent downwards and anthers that lie flat but rise towards the tip, whereas subsp. ardernei has stamens that are bow-shaped to horizontal, and horizontal anthers. W. borbonica subsp. ardernei is named in honour of H.M. Arderne, the Cape Town businessman whose family established the Arderne Gardens in Claremont . This subspecies is best known for its white form that is well-established in cultivation. Ironically, only pink-flowered plants are known in the wild, they can be seen growing from Paarl, through the Du Toits Kloof Mountains to the Breede River Valley flood plain between Michell's Pass and Rawsonville.

The genus Watsonia has about 52 species and is centred in the southwestern parts of Western Cape but extends into Namaqualand, and is also found further north in southern KwaZulu-Natal and on the escarpment in Mpumalanga and Swaziland .",,"Watsonia borbonica is tough and easy to grow, with a long flowering period. It will continue to flower regularly as long as the corms do not become too crowded. It does best in full sun in well-drained, well-composted soil and although adapted to a winter rainfall climate, will thrive under summer rainfall conditions provided it is grown in well-drained soil. It needs occasional feeding during the growing season (autumn-winter-spring) with small doses of preferably organic fertilizer with a high concentration of potash-overfeeding results in too much leaf and fewer flowers.

It can withstand mild winter frost but should be lifted and stored dry during winter in cold climates. After flowering, the leaves and stems can be cut back. Stop watering pot-grown specimens and if necessary, move them to a cool, dry place for the rest of the dormant period. To avoid overcrowding and to get the most flowers, clumps are best lifted and divided every three to five years.

Suitable for any size of garden and ideal for the water-wise winter rainfall garden, Watsonia borbonica looks magnificent in mass plantings, planted in clumps in herbaceous borders and grown in large containers. Even when not in flower, its foliage is decorative and after flowering has finished, its purplish stems and seed capsules are also attractive.

Watsonia borbonica produces offsets (daughter corms) abundantly, and the easiest method of propagation is by division. Clumps can be lifted and divided at any time during the dormant season (December-April) and re-planted in autumn (March-April). After lifting, the corm must be stored in a cool, dry place or re-planted immediately to avoid mealy bug infestation.

Use a well-drained soil, e.g. a mixture of coarse sand and finely milled bark. Corms should be planted at a depth of approximately half their diameter, 40-60 mm deep. In the winter rainfall area the rains begin in autumn (usually around the beginning of April). Pot grown plants should be watered sparingly at this time, and after they have sprouted, the soil should be kept moist but not damp-the corms are not that sensitive to drying out but if kept too wet they may rot. Corms will flower within a few months of planting.

Seed is sown in autumn, from April until June, thinly, in deep (min. 10 cm) seed trays, to allow for root development. The soil medium should be well drained, a recommended mix being 2 parts sand : 2 parts compost : 1 part loam or equal parts sand and compost, and the seeds should be planted 3-4 mm deep, covered with clean sand and kept moist and lightly shaded.

It is also advisable to protect them from rain during this period. Seed germinates readily within 3 to 4 weeks. Watering should be reduced towards the end of the growing season and withheld completely when they are dormant, resuming only in the autumn. The plants should flower in their second or third year.",,,,,,,,
"Searsia erosa
","Searsia erosa
",,"This much-branched, evergreen shrub or small tree grows to about 4 m. in height, but spreads to about 9 m across. It is fairly fast growing and has brown bark. The trifoliate leaves are very distinctive. The leaflets are very long (up to 130 mm) and narrow (3 mm wide). They usually have toothed, jagged margins which look as if they have been gnawed, giving rise to the specific name. Leaves are attached to the stem by a petiole which is up to 30 mm long, but the leaflets are sessile. The leaflets appear leathery, hairless and sticky in texture, and olive-green or yellowish green in colour, with paler undersides. The midribs are prominent and crushed leaves often emit a strong turpentine or resinous odour.

Small, white or greenish yellow flowers, are borne in loose, slender sprays and appear in early summer from October to December. They are followed by yellowish, sometimes light brown, hairless and shinyfruits (drupes) from January to April.

","Searsia was named after Paul B. Sears (1891-1990) who was head of the Yale School of Botany, and erosa (Latin) refers to the leaf margins which are toothed or look gnawed.","Most of the species grown in southern Africa, belonging to the genus Rhus, have been placed in Searsia. There are about 91 taxa in southern Africa. Searsia are deciduous or evergreen shrubs and trees, armed or unarmed suffrutices, shrub or trees, and stems and branches have prominent lenticels. Leaves of this genus are compound with 3 leaflets (trifoliolate).",,"This plant is not grazed, but is good for conserving soil and preventing erosion. Branches as well as leaves can be used for thatching and making brooms, hence its common name. The plant is a good garden subject in harsh environments and is sometimes used for hedges. It is said to feature in rainmaking ceremonies in Lesotho (Palgrave1981) and various parts are used to treat diarrhoea in both man and cattle.

Searsia erosa has delicate, airy foliage. It can be grown in the garden as a soft, screening plant or hedge and it is attractive enough to use as a focal point in gardens where it grows well. It can be replaced in the garden by S. tenuinervis, in areas where the latter grows.

Searsia erosa survives extremes of temperature and thrives in gardens where temperatures soar to 42ºC in summer and plunge to -10ºC in winter. It grows well on stony and gravel soil as these are well drained. Avoid waterlogged soils with poor drainage.

This species grows easily from seed, if fresh, unparasitized seed can be found. Before planting the seed, place it in water. Discard all seeds that float to the surface, as they will not germinate. Rub off all fleshy bits from the remaining seed and dry the seeds in a sunny place. Then plant them in a mixture of gravel, loam and river sand. Only lightly cover the seeds and keep them moist, but never too damp. Seeds should start germinating about 8 weeks after sowing. Prick them out into individual bags when they have 4 leaves. Once plants are 0.5 m high they are ready to be planted out in the garden.",,,,,,,,
"Roella
","Roella
",,"Species of Roella are summer flowering dwarf shrubs or perennial herbs with an erect to prostrate habit. The leaves are alternate, linear or ovate, sessile, often with an axillary cluster of smaller leaves. Flowers are regular, sessile, terminal, and solitary or in groups or heads, bracts are leaf-like. The bell-shaped corolla is white, blue or pale blue, sometimes with darker spots on the inside at the base of each of the five lobes or very rarely yellow or red. The calyx has five lobes, which fuse at the base to form a short tube; the lobe margins are smooth, toothed or ciliate. Stamens are free, five, and inserted at the base of the corolla tube; filaments are expanded at the base forming a dome over a nectiferous disc; anthers are linear and attached to the filament at its base. The 2-chambered ovary is inferior and crowned by the nectiferous disc; the style is rod-like with 2 glands at the base of a 2-lobed stigma. In each chamber are numerous ovules. The fruit is a capsule which opens by an apical plug or longitudinal slits.","The genus was named in honour of the Dutch Anatomist, G. Roelle by Linnaeus in 1753.","Roella comprises over 20 species, endemic to South African where they are mostly confined to the Cape Floristic Region (CFR), with one species, R. glomerata, occurring along the east coast from the Eastern Cape to KwaZulu Natal.

The plants grow in sand, loamy or stony soil on inland or coastal flats and mountain slopes.",,"The species with large blue flowers are attractive and have been considered desirable as garden plants. However, attempts by horticulturalists at SANBI have shown that they are not easily propagated and cultivated.",,,R. glomerata is known to be used to treat lower back pain in areas of KwaZulu Natal where it occurs.,,,,,
Salvia scabra,Salvia scabra,,"Salvia scabra is an erect, herbaceous perennial, with branched stems forming a neat shrublet, 0.3 to 0.9 m tall, although usually no higher than 0.5 m. Although It does develop a woody rootstock, it cannot be thought of as a shrub. The stems are covered in dense, soft hairs without glands. The lyre-shaped leaves are lobed (lyrate-pinnatifid) with these lobes becoming more distinct with maturity. Both leaf surfaces are rough and covered in glandless hairs, with some oil globules on the underside. Petioles are up to 35 mm long.

The inflorescence is simple or branched, with up to 12 whorls of 4–6 flowers, radiating up the spikes. Floral leaves are tapering egg-shaped on the lower spike, with bracts present. Flowers are tubular, 25–40 mm long, lilac, mauve or purple. Upper corolla lip is straight. Flowering sporadically year round, peaking in summer. Calyx is also tubular, hairy and tinged mauve and barely expands when in fruit. Nutlet seeds are produced in groups of three and usually dark brown. They are moist and sticky when wet. Every plant produces hundreds of seeds and will readily self-seed, although it doesn’t appear to be weedy. Plants are long-lived for an herbaceous perennial and fruitful for more than 3 years in a garden.","Pliny the Elder, a Roman scientist and historian, was the first to use the name Salvia. Salvia is presumably derived from the Latin, salvus meaning ‘uninjured’, ‘whole’, ‘safe’, ‘well’ or ‘sound’ and salvare meaning ‘to save or heal’ (verb salvere, ‘to be in good health’), referring to the medicinal value of the plants. The epithet scabra means ‘rough-leaved’ and refers to the rough surface of the leaf.","Salvia scabra is from the southeast coast of South Africa. It can be found in coastal bush, along stream sides, hilly slopes and sandy shores, from Humansdorp to East London in the Eastern Cape, at altitudes from 15 to 450 m. The sage family consists of 800–900 species worldwide and has been popular since the 1970s for ornamental gardening. Ancient medieval and renaissance records mention the medicinal or magical use of Salvia. The diminutive habit of Salvia scabra compared to the large shrubby species, such as S. lutea-africana and S. lanceolata, is shared by other ornamental indigenous species, such as S. disermas, S. repens and S. namaensis.",,"Salvia scabra prefers a sunny, well drained area in the garden. It is water-wise once established, and will make a pleasing herbaceous border in combination with plants such as Hebenstretia dura, Diascia integerrima, Dimorphotheca or pelargoniums. They are also suitable as specimen container plants placed in a sunny position.

New plants are easy to propagate from seed or cuttings. Sow seeds late spring and early summer into general potting soil mix. Seedlings germinate quickly and seedlings can be transplanted into well-drained potting soil once first pair of true leaves appear. Take semi-hardwood tip cuttings in spring and summer. Cuttings must be without terminal flowering buds. Place in a rooting medium, 50% fine milled bark and 50% river sand (perlite, vermiculite and peat are alternatives). Place under mist or enclose in plastic bag to retain humidity. Keep warm but out of direct sunlight. Cuttings should root within 4 weeks.

The plants do not have any major pests, however, mealy bug can settle down near the base of the stems and leaves.",,,"Most sages contain essential oils and have long been used in cooking and medicine all over the world. Salvia scabra is no exception and its use by Xhosa people as a medicine for infants and as a purgative, in the form of a leaf paste or roots steeped in water, has been recorded.",,,,,
Restio multiflorus,Restio multiflorus,,"Restio multiflorus is a reed-like plant, which grows to a height of 1 m in its natural environment, but grows to a height of about 1.5 m if planted in a reasonably fertile soil with the normal amount of water given in a garden. The plants have strong, upright stems and grow in a more or less tufted form. Like many other Restionaceae, the young plants produce finely branched juvenile stems which increase the photosynthesis process and enable the plants to grow faster. R. multiflorus plants have a large amount of these juvenile stems, which are bright green in colour.

When the flowering stems start to grow in the second year they seem to rise like a fountain from this low base of fluffy stems, which produces a striking and very attractive plant. When mature after three years, the plants can reach a diameter of about 1 m at ground level. Plants of both sexes are strong growing and can easily reach an age of about seven years. The main growth period is at the end of the Cape winter (August to November).","The family name of Restionaceae refers to the Latin restis, which means cord or rope and alludes to the use of the plants in southern Africa. More than 400 species in about 40 genera of the Restionaceae family occur in the winter rainfall regions of South Africa and Australia, with outliers in Africa, Madagascar, Indo-China and Chile. The species name of multiflorus is derived from multus = many and flos = flower and refers to the many spikelets, each with their own lot of flowers, giving a many-flowered appearance.","Restio multiflorus has a wide distribution in the Cape Floristic Region of the Western Cape and occurs on the lower slopes of mountains from Piketberg in the north to the Bredasberg Plains in the south. The plants are often difficult to recognize as they can grow entangled in other fynbos vegetation, looking quite different to the plants in cultivation in a garden. The plants prefer to grow in cool, well-drained places and can be found on bedrock Table Mountain Sandstone as well as granite, shale or silcrete. Like the other reed species, the male and female flowers are on different plants and both are small. The plants flower during March - April in the Southern Hemisphere and produce seed during November or December. The male flowers are greenish yellow, but the female flowers are very pretty, small but pure white and very frilly. The flowering season is very short, only about two weeks and the decorative dark brown bracts around the male and female inflorescences provide a longer period of attraction, from about two months before the flowering starts, to just after the seed ripens.

The plants are wind pollinated. The wind distributes the pollen from the free-hanging anthers of the male flowers to the female inflorescence where the large bracts catch the pollen from the air and funnel it towards the female flowers. Sometimes bees are present, but always around the male plants, where they collect the pollen. The seeds ripen in small capsules, three seeds to a capsule. When the seeds are ripe, the capsule opens up and dispels the seeds, which makes daily inspection during the ripening period absolutely necessary, if the seeds are to be collected for propagation. The seeds are quite small, shiny, dark brown nuts and are produced in large quantities per plant.",,"This species is best used as an accent plant or grown in a large pot and can also be used in a fairly large garden as a plant in a large border, planted behind a group of smaller plants. The plants fit in with fynbos plants, other indigenous South African plants as well as any other plants in a garden. They can be used as if they were small shrubs and would provide the touch of grass-like plants now so fashionable in landscaping. Another use would be as a group of plants in a large landscaping project, the plants are especially suited to planting on a slope.

The plants are best grown from seed, which has a good germination rate and germinates even better if treated with smoke or 'Instant Smoke Plus' seed primer.

This species must be grown in full sun, prefers a well-drained soil and plenty of air movement. The plants adapt to a large variety of soil types. The best time for planting restios is at the beginning of the rainy season, as the plants need regular watering during the first six weeks to two months after planting. After this initial period the plants can survive with a little additional watering, but grow better with a normal garden watering regime. They may be fed with standard organic fertilizers based on seaweed, or by sprinkling the surrounding soil with a small amount of ammonium sulfate during the growing season. Restios will respond to regular watering by showing more robust growth, but they are essentially plants adapted to a long, dry season.

In the garden, plants should be grown with a regular amount of irrigation and are suited to cultivation in gardens in the Southern Hemisphere. As with other reed species, the roots are sensitive to a combination of frost and wet soil and in the Northern Hemisphere should be grown in pots.

This is a fast-growing species that will be nearly 1 m high one year after sowing and will have formed a handsome plant three years after sowing. The plants produce a new growth flush in the centre of the plant every year. The individual stems start to deteriorate during the third year but by that time already two new flushes of growth will have appeared for the yearly renewal of the plant. This governs the maintenance of the plant, which only needs a regular removal of the brown, dead stems on the outside part of the plant.",,,,,,,,
"Hermannia saccifera
","Hermannia saccifera
",,"In its natural habitat the plant is a low sprawling strangling shrublet to 400 mm, however in cultivation, although still a sprawler, it maintains a very compact habit, rarely exceeding 100 mm in height. The leaves are smooth, hairless, shiny, regularly toothed and bright green in colour. The flowers, usually 2 per peduncle, are bright yellow, pendulous, bell-shaped and cover the plant during spring (August to October) making quite a show.

","Hermannia saccifera was first described in 1858 as Mahernia saccifera by Turczanimow. It was later transferred to the genus Hermannia, by K. Schuman. Hermannia is named after Paul Herman (1640-1695), German professor of botany at Leyden and one of the first travellers and collectors at the Cape, while Mahernia is an anagram of Hermannia, although missing one of the n's, and has no significance other than that. The specific name saccifera is Latin and loosely translated means 'carrying or bearing a bag'. It is known locally as the komynbossie (cumin bush), and honey made from the nectar is known as komynheuning (cumin honey), presumably because the flavour it gives the honey is reminiscent of cumin.","Hermannia saccifera grows on stony clay slopes in the Riviersonderend Moutains to Bredasdorp in the Western Cape into the Eastern Cape. There are about 180 species of Hermannia, approximately162 of which occur in southern Africa and 11 in tropical Africa with 30 southern African species that extend their ranges into tropical Africa. There are only 3 species in America and 1 or more in Australia.",,"Hermannia saccifera is a medium to fast growing, evergreen, prostrate, mat-forming herbaceous perennial. It is best on a slope in a sunny position, in acidic to neutral, well-drained, sandy loam soil. A single plant can be expected to cover one square metre in a year. Hermannia saccifera is wind tolerant, but is sensitive to frost and requires protection in the colder regions of South Africa. It also qualifies as a water-wise (drought tolerant) plant, and when established tolerates the winter rainfall - summer drought conditions in the Western Cape very well, but does require at least a weekly watering in summer to look its best. It has no major pests or diseases, and can be pruned to shape as required.

Propagation is by seed or cuttings, but seed grown plants appear to make stronger plants and are quicker to establish themselves when planted out than those produced by cuttings. Seed is best sown in late summer to autumn, or in spring. The seedlings should emerge within 10 days and can be pricked out when large enough to handle. Softwood or herbaceous cuttings should be taken from a vigorous actively growing mother plant in spring to early summer, treated with a rooting hormone, and placed in a propagation unit with bottom heat of up to 28C (80F) and intermittent mist. Rooting should occur within 4 weeks, with a 40% success rate.",,,,,,,,
Serruria cyanoides,Serruria cyanoides,,"Serruria cyanoides is a small, densely branched, multi-stemmed, resprouting shrublet, reaching a height of 400 mm. The dissected leaves, which are typical of this species, point upwards towards the flowerhead and are hairless when mature. The plant produces a solitary, sweetly-scented, pink flowerhead, and flowers from mid-winter until late spring (July to October). The seeds are released within two months of flowering.","Serruria was named in honour of J. Serrurier, a professor of botany at the University of Utrecht in the early eighteenth century. The specific name cyanoides refers to the resemblance of its inflorescence to that of Cyanea, a lobeliad from Hawaii.","The genus is mainly found in the winter rainfall region, only Serruria fasciflora extends eastwards to the Langeberg Mountains. Serruria is the largest of a group of four closely related genera, Paranomus, Spatalla and Sorocephalus. The genus has about 50 species and is in fact one of the largest of the African genera of Proteaceae. S. cyanoides was once common on the Cape Flats but has disappeared in this area due to urbanization and the invasion of alien species. The common name derives from the area in which it originally existed, Wynberg. The remaining population now survives above the coastal town of Fish Hoek and at Karbonkelberg in Hout Bay. Natural Habitat and ecology Herbarium labels indicate that this species occurred at altitudes of 30 to 550 m on hill slopes and on flats. Collection sites on record are dunes at the lowest altitudes and sandy southeast slopes of mountains at the highest altitudes. Serruria cyanoides now grows in acidic sandy soils at altitudes up to 150 m in isolated populations of a few hundred plants. The Wynberg spiderhead reproduces from seed. Once the seed ripens it is shed from the older flowers and falls to the ground. The seeds are small, hard, oval nuts covered by a fleshy layer called the elaisome. The elaisome layer attracts ants that carry the seeds to their underground nest where the elaiosme is consumed. The seeds remain in the nest until conditions are right to germinate. This is one fascinating way of that the plant reseeds itself. S. cyanoides is also adapted to survive fires, which occur in the fynbos biome, by resprouting. It has an underground rootstock that survives the fires. Although the above-ground parts of the plant are burnt, new shoots develop from the rootstock. This is another method by which the plant ensures its survival.",,"Serruria cyanoides is propagated from cuttings or from seed. Tip or heel cuttings are taken during spring or autumn. A rooting hormone is applied to the semi-hardwood cuttings that will stimulate rooting. The cuttings are rooted in a mixture of 50% milled pine bark and 50% polystyrene granules. Good rooting will only take place if the propagation house has misting and underbench heating. Rooting will take place from 5 weeks onwards. Once the cuttings have rooted, they are hardened off for 4 weeks before being planted. The rooted cuttings should be planted in a fynbos type soil medium. Fynbos type soils are usually nutrient poor and acidic. A suitable well-drained fynbos soil mixture consists of a mixture of acidic river sand, composted pine bark in equal parts and loam/topsoil.

Seed is collected from a mature flowerhead. The seed is sown in late summer or early autumn as the effects of higher day temperatures and cooler night temperatures play a vital role in initiating germination. The seeds can also be exposed to short periods of high temperatures followed by cooling water, which, by mimicking the autumn temperature regime, stimulates the seed to germinate very well. The seeds should be treated with a fungicide that prevents pre- and post-emergence damping off. Transplant the seedlings as soon as they are large enough to handle.

The young seedlings or potted cuttings should be grown in an area that is well ventilated and well lit. The plants should preferably be watered in the morning and may be fed with an organic seaweed-based fertilizer. The young plants can be planted out into the garden in autumn or during the cooler months. This allows the root system to become established before the onset of the hot, dry summer and gives the young plant a better chance to survive and thrive. Serruria cyanoides is best suited to sandy soil, and will grow well in fynbos or sandveld gardens. It is a small shrub, so plant it among other slightly taller plants, or in the front of a bed as an edging plant. Being a resprouter, it should not mind the occasional pruning to keep it neat and compact. Plant in full sunlight and ensure that the soil is well drained. Mulching with compost or woodchips during summer will keep the soil cool and help feed the plants.",,,,,,,,

Plants of var. addoensis and var. scaposa have been well established in cultivation ( ex situ conservation) and grown by succulent plant enthusiasts.

Three varieties of Caputia scaposa have been recognised; var. scaposa is only known from Badspoort in the Klein Karoo in the Western Cape to the Kei River in the Eastern Cape, growing on sandstone ledges of sheer cliffs or rocky hills mainly in quartzitic, sandstone-derived soils. They are often found on steep slopes, and dry river valleys. The vegetation consists mainly of Albany Thicket, however, at the Kei River it consists of Eastern Valley Bushveld (Mucina et al. 2006). At Badspoort plants grow in Gamka Thicket on sheer cliffs together with other succulents such as Bulbine ramosa, Tylecodon leucothrix, Albuca thermarum and Tromotriche choanantha.

Along the Kei River at its easternmost distribution, plants grow on cliffs sharing their habitat with Gasteria excelsa, Huernia pendula, Cotyledon woodii and Adromischus liebenbergii subsp. orientalis. At the Kouga Dam, plants were observed growing in Gamtoos Thicket on cliffs with Aloe pictifolia, Cotyledon tomentosa, Haworthia viscosa and Gasteria glomerata.

Var. adoensis grows near Addo and Enon in the Eastern Cape in Sundays Thicket. Var. caulescens has stems longer than 4 cm and with spoon-shaped leaf tips. The latter from near Enon, Eastern Cape.

Caputia scaposa is closely related to Caputia tomentosa with similar silvery white leaves, however the latter is a spreading, shrubby plant.

This species grows unarmed but finds it protection from the sheer cliffs. Although rain falls mainly in summer and winter and ranges from 250 -400 mm per annum, there is a tendency toward winter dryness. The average annual daily maximum temperature is about 24°C and the average daily minimum about 12°C. Caputia scaposa grows at an altitude of 100 -4 00m. The soil is sandy, mineral poor and acidic. The plants grow in full sun or light shade, the dense silvery hairs reflect the sun, an adaptation to the dry conditions.",,"Caputia scaposa is easily propagated from stem cuttings. It is best to allow the stem cuttings to form a heel, by placing them on a dry window sill for one to three weeks. Cuttings are best rooted in a small container in a well-drained medium. Grow in sand or gravel and place in a warm sunny position. Cuttings can be taken throughout the year but spring or summer are best, when cuttings should rapidly root within three or four weeks. Once rooted, they can be planted out in a sunny, well-drained spot in the garden. Best to feed plants with an organic fertiliser (compost or any other liquid fertiliser). Although Caputia scaposa can be watered at any time of the year, watering should be reduced in winter.",,,,,,,,
Diascia patens,Diascia patens,,"Diascia patens is a low-growing, well-branched, scrambling herbaceous perennial with a woody base. Mature plants vary in height from 0.4-1 m. Light green, hairless leaves are wedge-shaped at the base and taper to a sharp tip. The leaf margins are entire or have a few sharp teeth. The leaf size diminishes upwards towards the inflorescence.

Single flowers are arranged along an elongated, unbranched axis (raceme) forming a lax inflorescence produced on terminal branches which clamber up neighbouring plants for support. Usually Diascia patens has a smattering of small dark pink flowers, however there are forms from the Little Karoo with salmon blooms. Flowers are produced in late spring through summer, and under favourable conditions into autumn. Individual flowers present themselves with a long broad lower lip and four smaller bonnet-type petals with translucent interior markings referred to as windows. The yellow window visible on the upper petals, is fairly deep-set and shallowly concave. The common name twinspurs refers to the two lateral corolla tube spurs, 4-5 mm long, which are straight and diverge at a 45° angle, with a central patch of dark sessile glands present at the base of the lower lip. These glands consist of oil-bearing cells and are called elaiophores. The oil attracts pollinators. Capsules contain urn-shaped seeds which are curved, winged and ridged.","Diascia is derived from the Greek words, di, two, and askos, sac, referring to the pair of translucent yellow sacs/windows in the corolla and not to the two spurs which are absent in the type specimen D. bergiana. It is thought that the epithet patens was given by Thunberg because of the characteristically narrow, outspread leaves of the species. The first collections of Diascia patens are about two hundred years old. Thunberg made the original collection, but the locality was not recorded. A second journey was made to Kaffraria, the British colony in the southeastern part of the Eastern Cape in the region of King Williams Town and East London. The Langekloof and Uniondale districts were visited during these travels where more collections were made.

Specimens by other early collectors such as Burchell and Taylor have helped solve the puzzle of the locality of Thunberg's original specimen.

Diascia was not described until 1820 and early specimens of D. patens were placed under long-established genera, such as Antirrhinum, Linaria and Nemesia, until they were appropriately classified with regard to their characteristic twin spurs. Diascia patens `Cheeky Chief' was collected by a Kirstenbosch horticulturist, A. Harrower, in 2005. Selections based on flower colour, flower size, compactness and a long flowering season were made to bring forth this playful cultivar.","Diascia patens is endemic to South Africa and can be found at altitudes of 500-1372 m in the Eastern and Western Cape. Little is known of the species, but from collectors' notations it is accepted that the plants occur in rocky sites and in streamside thickets.
There is a salmon-coloured cultivar, D. patens `Cheeky Chief', which was collected and subsequently selected by a Kirstenbosch horticulturist from a small population which occurs outside of Oudtshoorn.There are 70 species of Diascia endemic to southern Africa found mostly in the eastern regions including Lesotho, Free State, KwaZulu-Natal and Eastern Cape Province. Most species found in the latter are annuals.Diascia patens is related to D. capsularis and can be recognised by its 2-4.5 mm broad, narrower, linear leaves, which are not 5-17 mm broad and triangular as in D. capsularis. Other features that set D. patens apart are its shorter spurs, filaments and style.",,"Diascia patens is a hardy, fairly drought-tolerant species. It thrives in sunny or lightly shaded positions. In the wild, it tends to grow along streams or in the moist shade of rocks or large grass tussocks. It can be surprisingly tough for such a delicate-looking plant.

Diascia species are easily propagated vegetatively. Select non-flowering softwood cuttings, 50-60 mm long, taken when the plants are actively growing, in spring. Cuttings usually strike quickly, within two weeks, without heat or special treatment. For hollow-stemmed species it is better to try cuttings with a good node at the end, or heel cuttings taken from basal shoots. Cuttings taken in autumn root and overwinter well, but thrive only once the weather warms up in spring. Plant rooted cuttings into small pots in a humus-rich, friable and well-drained potting mix. Cut back mature plants in midsummer to improve the flower display. Diascia species can regularly receive a good slow-release fertilizer to keep them vigorous and healthy.

Slugs and snails damage small plants. Red spider mite and mealy bug can be troublesome pests which should be treated with an appropriate insecticide, either organic or chemical, as soon as noticed. Lack of sunshine will cause floppy, elongated growth. Usually Diascia species are vigorous and pest free.",,,,,,,,
Restio subverticillatus,Restio subverticillatus,,"Restio subverticillatus is a tufted reed-like plant up to 2 m high and up to 1.5 m in diameter. It has a very distinctive growth form with cane-like stems, which have soft green whorls of modified branches at each node. Male and female flowers are produced on separate plants, the female flowers are white, the male flowers greenish-yellow and quite insignificant.

","The genus name Restio and family name Restionaceae refer to the Latin restis, which means cord or rope and alludes to the use of the plants in southern Africa. The more than 400 species in about 40 genera of the Restionaceae family occur in the winter-rainfall regions of South Africa and Australia, with outliers in Africa, Madagascar, Indo-China and Chile. The species name of subverticillatus is from the Latin verticillata and means somewhat (sub) whorled, referring to the branches, which appear in poorly defined whorls at each node.

This species was until recently known as Ischyrolepis subverticillata, but recent studies on plastid sequence data show that the genus Ischyrolepis should be included within the the genus Restio. The name Ischyrolepis means 'strong scale' from the Greek ischyros and lepis meaning 'strong' and 'scale' respectively, and refers to the tough floral scales that enclose the flowers.","In nature the plants can be found on Table Mountain sandstone bedrock in mountain valleys in the South Western Cape, from Caledon to Paarl.They typically occur along streamlines or along the margins of the riverine scrub-forest, where they receive some groundwater throughout the year. The flowering time is during autumn, March or April, and the seed is ripe in early summer, November, while the main growth flush is in winter, spring and early summer, from August to January. As all restios, the plants are wind pollinated, although the bees have a few days during the flowering season when they are busy harvesting the pollen from the male plants.This restio has two survival mechanisms for existence in the fire-prone fynbos. It produces a large amount of viable seeds to be stored in the soil and it coppices from the rhizome or base after a fire.The pretty silvery seeds ripen in small capsules and it is at this stage that the female plant is at its best for use as cut-foliage, with tall arching stems and nearly black capsules at the end of each dark green whorl of foliage.",,"The plants are best grown from seed, which has a good germination percentage and germinates even better if treated with smoke or 'Instant Smoke Plus' seed primer. This species can grow in full sun, partial- or half shade and prefers a well-drained soil and plenty of air movement. The plants adapt to a large variety of soil types. The best time for planting restios is at the beginning of the rainy season, as the plants need regular watering during the first six weeks to two months after planting. After this initial period the plants can survive with a little additional watering but grow better with a normal garden watering regime. They may be fed with standard organic fertilizers such as Seagro or Kelpak, or by sprinkling the surrounding soil with a small amount of ammonium sulfate during the growing season. Restios will respond to regular watering by showing more robust growth, but they are essentially plants which are adapted to a long dry season.

This is a fast growing species that will reach about 1 m high one year after sowing and will have formed a handsome plant three years after sowing. The plants produce a new growth flush in the centre of the plant every year. The individual stems start to deteriorate during the third year, but by that time already two new flushesof growth will have appeared for the yearly renewal of the plant. This governs the maintenance of the plant, which really only needs a regular removal of the brown, dead stems at the outside part of the plant.",,,"The economic use of plants of this family has beenlimited, as the plants contain a large amount of tannin and so are grazed only as a last resort by cattle and sheep. The species that have simple unbranched stems are sometimes used for thatching, while the species with branched stems can be used to make a broom, in Afrikaans besem.",,,,,
Ochna,Ochna,,"The genus Ochna comprises shrublets, shrubs and trees that are usually hairless. The growing tips of the stems are conical and sometimes have overlapping bracts. The leaves are simple, in an alternate or spiral arrangement and the midrib is ridged above and below. There are numerous lateral veins that are parallel, closely spaced and visible above. The margins are usually dentate, with entire stipules or with a fringed margin, or 2-lobed but not so deeply. The flowers are bisexual with floral parts in fives, in solitary or in terminal inflorescences or panicles, often with short, lateral branchlets. The sepals of the calyx are persistent, becoming enlarged, cream-coloured or pink to bright red and petal-like. There are 5-10 petals which are larger than the sepals, but they fall very early after opening. There are many free stamens, about 12 or more with filaments partly persistent. The ovary consists of 1-8 distinct carpels, developing on the swollen red receptacle. The fruits of Ochna are fleshy drupelets with a thin outer layer or coat. They are narrowly ovoid, almost spherical or kidney-shaped and coloured, attached to the base of the receptacle and surrounded by petal-like sepals.","The genus Ochna was named by Linnaeus in 1753 and is derived from the Greek word, ochne, which refers to the wild pear, alluding to the leaves that resemble those of the wild pear.","There are about 86 species of this genus; found mostly in and around the Mascarene Islands, Africa and Asian countries. In South Africa there are 12 species and twenty species in southern Africa, including Zimbabwe and Mozambique.",,"The seeds of Ochna species are simple to germinate. Firstly, collect ripe fruits preferably just after dawn. Clean off the outer seed coat and sow immediately after the seed has been removed. Sow seeds in a seedling mix and keep on a heated bed. Keep the seedling mixture damp to assist germination, which takes about 10 days, the time varying with the species. The seedlings prefer sunlight and tend to grow slowly. Regularly remove weeds in the tray, so as to prevent weeds from overshadowing the seedlings.",,,,,,,,
Scabiosa drakensbergensis,Scabiosa drakensbergensis,,"This leafy evergreen perennial herb can produce quite a big lanky spread and can reach a height of up to 1.5 m tall. It has wide, attractive leaves in opposite pairs up the stem. The leaves are more lush in appearance and somewhat less rough to the touch than in other scabiosa plants, and their margins are coarsely toothed with narrow upper segments. The stems are hollow and densely softly hairy.

Flowers are white, with white stamens protruding, and are crowded at the end of slender leafless stalks up to 300 mm long.

A closer look reveals that each flower head is surrounded at the base by one to two rows of bracts and that the calyx lobes have long bristles. Each flower head is made up of many small flowers and these individual flowers are crowded together, with the looser flowers along the outside having longer petals that form a frilly edge, and the flowers in the centre being much smaller and compact to form a tight button effect. Flowering period is throughout summer, starting in October and usually finishing around April. After flowering, the heads turn into tight, bristly balls that fall apart as the seeds ripen, and these rounded bristle-heads slowly fall apart as the seeds ripen to be blown away by the wind.","The plant is named after the Latin word scabiosus, either because the leaves of some species are rough or have a felt-like texture, or for the complaint 'scabies' which was often treated with Scabiosa species.The specific epithet ""drakensbergensis"" refers to the area where this species occurs naturally in South Africa.","Scabiosa drakensbergensis occurs naturally in rocky places, on margins of scrub and in grassland areas at altitudes of 1 500-2 000 m.

In South Africa it occurs in the Limpopo, Free State, and KwaZulu-Natal provinces.The family Dipsacaceae comprises 11 genera and 290 species, and occurs throughout the Mediterranean, Middle East, Europe, Africa and Asia. The scabious family consists of annual and perennial herbs with leaves that occur mainly in a basal rosette and are either lobed or divided, and with flowers clustered in dense heads, surrounded by a whorl of single or overlapping bracts. South Africa has 9 species. Related species that are better known are Scabiosa africana, S. incisa and S. columbaria, all of which are popular garden ornamentals.",,"Plant in full sun, although it can tolerate some shade for part of the day. Soil must be well drained with plenty of compost. Mulch well, and water regularly. Feed at 8 week intervals with any slow-release or organic fertiliser.

New plants grow fast, flowering usually within their first year. Older plants tend to get untidy. Cut the old long woody stalks right back after flowering. Prune lightly and regularly overall to maintain an informal yet tidy shape. This will encourage the plant to make many new shoots from the base. Also remove dead flowers after flowering to keep it neat. It will do well in the garden for 2 to 4 years after which it should be replaced.

Propagate in spring from seed or cuttings (softwood or herbaceous). You can also lift and replant younger newly-rooted sections where the longer stems have been in contact with the ground.

Scabiosa drakensbergensis has no serious pests.",,,Leaves and roots of Scabiosa are known to have medicinal uses. But this scabiosa's value is mainly horticultural. All scabiosa flowers last well in a vase.,,,,,
Aloiampelos,Aloiampelos,,"All the representatives of this genus are characterised by being creeping, shrubby, or climbing succulent perennials. Leaves are spirally arranged, with a distinct sheath and separated by prominent internodes along the length of the mostly slender stems. Leaves are of medium length, rather narrow, thin, and unspotted, with only small, soft, harmless teeth on the margins. Leaf exudate is normally absent, or minimal and watery when present. Inflorescences are usually unbranched with lax to subdense cylindrical, or dense head-shaped racemes (flower heads). However, some forms of especially Aloiampelos ciliaris and A. tenuior can bear densely-flowered racemes, and if given horticultural attention in a garden setting, will often produce branched inflorescences (panicles). Flowers are rather small, cylindrical, sometimes banana-shaped, or with a slight constriction in the middle, and range from yellow through orange to red, and are often greenish-tinged.","The name of the genus is derived from Aloe and the Greek word for a climbing plant (ampelos). This refers to the general climbing habit of the scrambling aloes. These plants were previously included in the genus Aloe, as Aloe section Macrifoliae (Haw.) Glen & D.S.Hardy.","Of the ten taxa in this genus, 4 are threatened, while the remaining 6 taxa are regarded as being of Least Concern (LC). Three of the threatened taxa, A. ciliaris var. redacta, A. commixta and A. decumbens, are assessed as being Vulnerable (VU), while the fourth, A. juddii, is Endangered (EN). The most noticeable threat to these plants is habitat loss, mostly as a result of alien plant encroachment, as well as land degradation, and illegal collecting. With the exception of A. ciliaris var. redacta, the other threatened Aloiampelos taxa essentially occur in the fynbos region of the Western Cape, an area in which winter rainfall predominates.

Aloiampelos is comprised of 7 species of which one species has 3 varieties and another 2 varieties. The genus is endemic to South Africa, with most of the taxa occurring in the Western and Eastern Cape. One taxon (A. striatula var. striatula) also occurs on the Free State-Lesotho border and another (A. tenuior) as far northeast as the border of KwaZulu-Natal and Swaziland. Members of Aloiampelos grow in fynbos, forest, thicket, grassland or savanna vegetation. They are often found on the ecotone between different vegetation types and some taxa prefer rocky outcrops. They occur in both the winter and summer rainfall regions. While the distribution of most taxa in this genus is rather close to the coast, some of the species occur at higher altitudes inland, e.g. A. striatula.",,"Some of the scrambling aloes generally make attractive garden plants, provided that they have ample space to spread and that the often slender stems are supported by a nearby tree of shrub, or that the plants are allowed to form dense, self-supporting clumps. They can be successfully used as vertically trained, background plants in large beds. The easiest way to propagate the rambling aloes is with stem cuttings. Cuttings should be taken with a sharp knife or pair of secateurs and be allowed to dry in the shade for a few days before planting them directly in the garden where the plant is needed.

Aloiampelos ciliaris is one of easiest aloes to grow from cuttings that ideally should be initially provided with semi-shade, but plants will soon flourish in full sun. Plants benefit from being watered throughout the year. Aloiampelos striatula is frost hardy and can be utilised with success in gardens in areas with cold winters. However, it is often shy to flower in cultivation. It should be planted in heavy soil and watered well during summer. Aloiampelos tenuior flowers profusely in spring and summer, making it ideal for gardens in a mild climate. It prefers heavy soil and can tolerate some frost, but should be protected against wind, harsh sunlight, and severe frost. Aloiampelos commixta should be planted in sandy soils and watered well during the winter months. It is not very frost tolerant and should also be protected from direct sunlight. Aloiampelos gracilis should be planted in semi-shade in a rich, well-drained soil and watered throughout the year. It might not be possible, or very challenging, to successfully cultivate species that originate from the winter rainfall region in summer rainfall gardens.",,,,,,,,
Vachellia kosiensis,Vachellia kosiensis,,"A tall, upright tree, 10 to 17 m, with a spreading crown. Stems are pale, greyish white, with shallow, red-lined fissures in the bark. Young branches may show zigzagging growth. Spines are straight, paired, white and borne in profusion, but are variable in size, from very short to up to 200 mm long. Spines persist on the main stems.Leaves are bright green, up to 35 mm long. The rachis is densely velvety hairy. Leaflets are in 15–17 pairs, each 5.5 × 1.5 mm, and are not hairy. Flowers are clusters of bright yellow balls, on short branches, hidden among the leaves, in summer (November to April).Pods are sickle-shaped, reddish brown when mature, narrow and long, up to 188 × 6 mm, with marked constrictions between the seeds. They mature in late summer and winter (February to August).This species is most easily confused with its close relative, the Sweet Thorn, Vachellia karroo, and was previously considered to be a coastal form of it. They can be told apart by Vachellia karroo having flowers at the branch ends.","The genus Vachellia is named after the Rev. George Harvey Vachell (1798–1839), chaplain to the British East India Company in Macao from 1825–1836 and a plant collector in China. This species is named for its place of origin, kosiensis means ‘from Kosi Bay’.

The most prevalent use of this species, is as a pioneer tree for sand dune reclamation after mining of sand dunes in the Richard’s Bay region.

A mixed grove of different acacias in a garden, makes for a garden full of birds and insects. Acacia Veld is one of the most productive habitats that you can have from a wildlife point of view. Bring this habitat into a garden and you will never be short of interest. Plus the braai fire will always be burning!

The tree is very fast growing under full sun conditions. It prefers deep, sandy soils and plenty of rain in summer. It is suitable for coastal areas. This species will flower after about 3–5 years from seed, under ideal conditions, such as on the KZN coast.

This tree can be grown in temperate climates, and where exposed to strong winds, such as Cape Town’s ‘south-easter’, it will grow or lean away from the predominant wind direction.

This tree is propagated by seed, which germinates easily after about 7 days. Nick the hard seed coat, or rub the seeds on sandpaper until the dark outer coating is thin enough to see the pale seedling leaf (cotyledon) beneath. Then soak these scarified seeds in water overnight or until they begin to swell. Once the swelling process has started, transfer the seeds to a normal, well-drained seedling mixture of sand and sieved organic matter. Sow the seeds on the mixture and lightly cover the seeds with the same mixture, just to hold them in place, and keep the moisture high around the seed itself. Leave the seedling trays in full sun; this hardens the seedlings off quickly and helps to reduce the attack by soil fungi. Sunlight is still the best sterilizing agent.",,,"This tree’s wood makes a fine firewood and produces a wonderful set of coals for cooking. It can also be used to make fence posts, poles, yokes and furniture.

Encephalartos striatus,Encephalartos striatus,,"Encephalartos striatus is a small cycad with a subterranean stem about 30 cm in length and 25 cm in diameter. It is normally a solitary plant, which only branches when it is injured.

Leaves are about 1-2 m long, glossy bright green, straight, covered with a silky layer of hair when young. The median leaflets are 10-20 cm long and 1-1.5 cm broad, with one or two teeth on one or both margins. The leaflets decrease in size towards the base, but not to prickles, leaving the lower 15-20 cm of the leaf stalk bare to the base.

Male and female plants produce up to 4 cones which remain green at maturity. Male cones are narrowly cylindrical, 20-30 cm long and 8-10 cm in diameter. Pollen shedding takes place during May-September. Female cones are broadly cylindrical, 25-30 cm long and 12-15 cm in diameter. The female cones disintegrate spontaneously during September-December. Seeds are bright red; seed kernels are unique among the South African cycad species in that their surface is covered with small knobs.

Encephalartos striatus is often confused with E. villosus and even more often with E. cerinus.","The epithet striatus (meaning marked with longitudinal lines) refers to the leaflets, and the epithet of the synonym umbeluziensis refers to the place where the species occurs, namely the Umbeluzi River.","The species is restricted to the valley of the Umbeluzi River, both in Swaziland and Mozambique. It grows in sparse to dense deciduous low forests, under hot and dry conditions, in low scrub. The annual rainfall of the region varies from 625-750 mm and occurs mainly in summer. The species is a relatively slow grower. It grows best in light shade and is frost hardy.",,"Encephalartos striatus is easily propagated from seeds, but seedlings, at the one-leaf stage, are susceptible to the fungal disease ""damping off"" which kills the seedling's single leaf at ground level. The seeds should be collected, cleaned and stored in a brown paper bag at 10-15 ºC for six months or more, to allow the embryo to fully develop. The seeds are cleaned to ensure that all the flesh is removed since it may contain germination inhibitors, and can also promote the growth of fungi. The flesh is scraped away with a knife, and protective gloves should be worn during the cleaning operation to prevent contact with the slow-acting poisons present in the flesh. If the flesh is hard and dry, it helps to soak the seeds in water for a day or two before cleaning. Even if the seeds have been cleaned, it is a good idea to soak them for a few days, preferably with daily changes of water, before planting them. When the seeds are placed in water, the viable ones will sink and the non-viable ones will float.

To germinate the seeds, place the cleaned seeds on their sides half buried on washed sand or potting mix, and keep at about 28 ºC. It is necessary to keep the medium moist, but not too wet, for as long as it takes for germination to take place. As soon as the radicals of the sprouted kernels are 10-20 mm long, they can be planted singly in bags containing potting soil or some other suitable medium. Alternatively one can wait until the seedlings develop one or two leaves before transplanting them individually into bags.

Because cycad seedlings form long tap roots, it is advisable to use tall, narrow perforated black plastic bags about 24 x12 cm in size for their initial establishment. Place the seedlings under shade for the first few years of growth and development. Initially the seedlings must be watered daily with a fine spray. After about a month, as their roots elongate, the frequency of watering should be decreased to once a week. The seedlings can be transplanted into the garden when they are 3-5 years old. Cycads are ideal for a low maintenance garden, as they require a minimum of water and are undemanding in their soil and environmental needs.

Pests troublesome to cycads are scale insects, beetles and chewing insects. Scale insects cause great damage to cycad leaves by sucking the sap from them. Most scale insects can be controlled with regular and frequent applications of horticultural soluble oil such as white oil. Beetles seriously damage cycad plants by attacking the emerging young leaves. Control can be kept by application of contact or systemic insecticides, or one of the bacterial preparations available.

Everyone in possession of cycads must have a permit. Please contact your provincial Nature Conservation authority for details.",,,,,,,,
Barleria rigida,Barleria rigida,,"A much-branched shrublet, up to 400 mm high. The stems arising from a woody rootstock. Younger stems are covered with hairs, whereas the older stems become glabrous.

Barleria rigida is pollinated by insects and attracts various species of butterflies.",,"This species is recommended for rockeries and sunny gardens and tolerates frost and droughts. Barleria rigida flowers in abundance when watering is minimized. Too much water stimulates vegetative growth and less flower production.

Barleria rigida can easily be propagated from seeds or cuttings. Harvest the ripe seeds when the capsules turn brown. Use 1 part of washed river sand and 2 parts potting medium, as a growing medium for germination. Place the tray with seeds in a shady spot and water once a week. Germination starts to take place in fourteen days. Transplant the seedlings when 10 cm in size.

Semi-hard plant material is the best for cuttings. Cut the cuttings in lengths of 10 cm.The most effective mixture to root the cuttings in, is 1 part of coarse river sand and 2 parts of potting mix. Good drainage is essential. Treat the cuttings with a rooting hormone. Plant the cuttings 5 cm. apart. Place the container in a shady spot and water twice a week.

Lachenalia corymbosa,Lachenalia corymbosa,strongly scented,"Lachenalia corymbosa is a strongly scented, autumn- and early winter-flowering plant, and its diminutive size makes it highly recommended for cultivation in containers and window boxes in sunny positions. L. corymbosa is a deciduous, winter-growing species, 50-100 mm high, that becomes completely dormant during the hot, dry summer, surviving the latter period by means of a soft, fleshy bulb. The bulbs respond rapidly to the first autumn rains, producing their dense flower clusters and several narrow, grass-like leaves more or less at the same time. The flowers are long-lasting (individual flowers last about 10 days), and are about 15 mm wide and 15 mm high. They are strongly honey-scented, and are pollinated by the common honey-bee, Apis mellifera. Like the other members of this genus, L. corymbosa has developed a remarkable seed dispersal mechanism, in which the subterranean portion of the peduncle (flower stem) elongates rapidly in late winter, just before the seed capsules split open. This has the effect of lifting the capsules into the air, which then bend over and fall to the ground a short distance away from the adult plants, releasing the seeds that can then be further dispersed by raindrops and wind.","The genus Lachenalia was established in 1784 and commemorates Werner de Lachenal (1739-1800), professor of botany and anatomy at the University of Basel, Switzerland. The previous generic name Polyxena honours the Greek mythological figure of Polyxena, a daughter of Priam, the last King of Troy, and was established by the German botanist C.S. Kunth in 1843. The specific epithet corymbosa refers to the type of inflorescence this species has, i.e. a subcorymb, in which the flowers all bloom at more or less the same level. L. corymbosa has had quite a complicated taxonomic history. It was previously known as Polyxena corymbosa and before that was well known by its former name Hyacinthus corymbosus. However, the genus Hyacinthus now only applies to the deliciously sweet-scented species from the Northern Hemisphere, including the numerous hyacinth cultivars we know and grow today as pot plants.","Lachenalia corymbosa is restricted to the winter rainfall region of the Western Cape, occurring in colonies on seasonally moist flats from the Olifants River Valley near Citrusdal to Somerset West and Gordon's Bay on the Cape Flats. Unfortunately it has become rare on the Cape Peninsula and the Cape Flats over the past few decades due to the development of roads, housing and industrial sites.",,"The truly dwarf nature of L. corymbosa makes it exclusively the preserve of pot cultivation as the small fleshy bulbs resent any kind of soil disturbance such as that caused by surface-foraging runner moles. As the bulbs have a shallow root system, they can be cultivated in a wide variety of shallow containers. Place the pots in a sunny position or one that receives high light intensity for at least half the day. In the Southern Hemisphere, plastic pots are preferred over terracotta ones as the latter tend to dry out too rapidly. The plants are seen to best advantage massed closely together, and planted in a free-draining mix such as equal parts of coarse river sand and finely sifted compost or finely milled bark.

Plant the bulbs in early autumn about 15 mm apart and about 10 mm deep. Water well and wait for the leaves to show, then water well once per week throughout the winter and early spring period, reducing water by the end of spring, and allowing the soil medium to dry out completely over summer. During the flowering period (late March to mid-May in the Southern Hemisphere), pots can be brought indoors where their brilliant flowers and strong sweet scent can be fully appreciated. L. corymbosa is not frost hardy and has to be grown in the cool greenhouse in cold climate countries of the Northern Hemisphere.

L. corymbosa is propagated by seeds sown in autumn, or by separation of offsets during the summer dormant period. Seeds can be sown directly into permanent containers, at a depth of about 2-3 mm, in the same medium recommended for adult bulbs. Be sure to sow the seeds thinly to prevent overcrowding, and keep the sowing medium moist by watering every few days with a fine spray. Germination of fresh seeds takes place within 3 weeks, and under ideal conditions flowers may be produced for the first time during the second season of growth.

The bulbs of L. corymbosa are long lasting and offsets form rapidly. When clumps become too thick and flowering performance diminishes, about every three to four years, the dormant bulbs can be lifted in summer and the offsets separated, and preferably replanted as soon as possible.

Like the other four species previously in the genus Polyxena, L. corymbosa is highly susceptible to infestation by mealy bugs that attack and multiply between the leaf bases and outer bulb tunics. Mealy bugs can transmit viral diseases from one plant to another, and are often spread by Argentine ants. Controlling ants goes a long way towards keeping L. corymbosa plants free from mealy bugs.",,,,,,,,
Gasteria armstrongii,Gasteria armstrongii,,"Plants without a stem (acaulescent), and with leaves (up to 3 pairs) remaining flat on the ground, one above the other in two opposite rows (distichous), solitary or proliferating from the base to form small clusters. Roots succulent, slightly dilating towards the middle. Leaves 30-60 mm long, 23-35 mm broad at the base, firm, triangular to triangular-lorate (lorate = strap-shaped), the inner ascending-spreading, the outer spreading; the upper surface channelled towards the base; lower surface somewhat convex without a keel; both surfaces dark green, with dense to sparse whitish tubercles arranged in irregular transverse bands; the leaf tip is acute, bearing a short sharp point (mucro); the leaf margin is horny, acute and entire. Inflorescence an ascending solitary raceme, 400-500 mm long. Pedicel 5-6 mm long. The perianth is about 20-24 mm long, reddish-pink, the base swollen for more than half its length. Stamens 20-24 mm long, anthers 2 mm long, oblong, included or slightly protruding, the style about 18-24 mm long, exceeding the anthers at the end of the flowering period. The fruiting capsule 20-25 mm long, 6-8 mm in diameter. Seeds about 3-4 mm long, black, flattish.","Gasteria armstrongii was named by the botanist Selmar Schönland (1860-1940), director of the Albany Museum in Grahamstown. The plant commemorates William Armstrong a plant enthusiast from Port Elizabeth. He is also commemorated in Freesia armstrongii (Gunn & Codd 1981).","Gasteria armstrongii is related to G. nitida which is a much larger grassland plant with a smooth leaf surface. The former is immediately recognized by its spreading leaves in two opposite rows of tuberculate, triangular to triangular-lorate, spreading leaves and solitary racemes. G. nitida is a much larger plant bearing smooth triangular-lanceolate leaves in a rosette and a branched inflorescence. G. armstrongii is an attractive dwarf species, a true stone plant resembling its pebbly background. Gasteria armstrongii is vulnerable, occurring in a popular farming region. It is also only known from a few sites along the Gamtoos River in the Eastern Cape. Although it is well camouflaged and difficult to find, it is threatened by collectors and ploughing. Plants grow on a flat terrain in Renosterveld vegetation. The plant has been well established in cultivation (ex situ preservation) and is grown by succulent plant enthusiasts all over the world.",,"Gasteria armstrongii thrives in cultivation and does best as a pot plant or grown in miniature rock gardens. It is a slow grower. It can also be grown out-of-doors, but is best cultivated in dry Mediterranean-type gardens where frost is not too severe. Although it can be grown in full sun, plants prefer some slight shade, and in hot climates should therefore be protected from full sun. Plants should reach flowering size in about 3 years.

Propagation

Easily propagated from seed, by division or from leaf cuttings. It is best to apply a fungicide when growing from seed. Sow seed during spring or summer in a warm, shady position in a sandy slightly acidic soil and keep moist. Cover with a thin layer of sand and keep moist. Germination is usually within 3 weeks. Seedlings grow slowly and are best planted out about a year after sowing. Propagation from leaf cuttings is best undertaken in spring. Allow the leaf cutting to form a heel by placing it on a dry window sill for a week or three. Cuttings are best rooted in clean sand. Once rooted, plants can be planted into individual containers. Plants react well to organic feeding (compost or any other liquid fertilizer). G. armstrongii is best watered throughout the year, but sparingly in winter.",,,,,,,,
Rock milk apricot,Ancylobotrys capensis,,"The rock milk apricot is an evergreen, multistemmed, densely branched, scrambling shrub, 1-2 m high or a lean, intertwining climber in which case it reaches heights of up to 5 m. The young branches and growth points are covered with soft, reddish brown hairs. The bark is reddish brown to greyish brown. All parts of the plant contain milky, rubbery latex.

The simple, opposite leaves are characteristically carried upright. They are leathery are oblong to broadly elliptic, 20-60 x 12-25 mm in dimension, dark green above and paler below and have pronounced herringbone veins on both sides.

The flower tube and segments are pinkish to reddish orange to white on the outside and brilliant white on the inside. The flowers are large and up to 30 mm wide, borne in dense, showy clusters at the tips of branches, and are sweetly scented.

The fruit are rounded to pear-shaped and 35-50 mm in diameter. They are dark green to lime-green when young, turning yellow to orange as they mature. The skin is somewhat fleshy and velvety and tough, but peels away easily. Inside are numerous seeds, varying from round to almost bean-like and embedded in the sweet-sour pulp. The fruit resembles the apricot in colour but the taste is certainly different - the flesh is tasty and slightly sour, especially close to the seed.","The generic name Ancylobotrys is derived from two Greek words: ancylo (crooked, hooked or bent) and botrys (cluster or bunch), referring to the clusters of flowers carried on bent flower stalks at the tips of the stem. The Latin epithet capensis means from the Cape. This plant was previously known as Landolphia capensis and should not be mistaken for Dovyalis zeyheri, which is also known as wild apricot. The genus Ancylobotrys is represented by five species in southern tropical Africa (Angola, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Malawi, Mozambique) and southern Africa. Ancylobotrys is closely related to Landolphia, the latter with 23 taxa in the same distribution area.","Ancylobotrys capensis occurs naturally in northern KwaZulu-Natal, Mpumalanga, Gauteng, Limpopo Province, North-West Province and southeastern Botswana. The wild apricot is a characteristic species of dry bush in rocky situations and grows in grassland and bushveld, mainly on the scarp and summit of rocky outcrops or on plains with rocky ridges. It is widely distributed and found frequently. It is common on quartzite koppies mainly in the Rocky Highveld vegetation type in the northern provinces of South Africa.",,"Plants are easily grown from fresh, clean seed collected from January to February when the fruit are ripening. Make sure to clean the seeds and plant them directly into acidic leaf compost. They usually germinate quickly but can take as long as three months. Young plants can be transplanted into well-drained soil in a semi-shaded situation. The branches like sun but the roots have to be kept cool (in nature they are sheltered form the heat of the sun below rocks). Unfortunately, these plants are extremely slow growers so if you decide to plant this species you have to be very patient.

This plant can be best used in rocky situations in a natural garden. It should be protected from frost in the cold months while young. An established plant is rather frost-tolerant and will easily resprout from the underground parts. It has a climbing habit but in the absence of supporting vegetation it can become an untidy bush. It can generally be pruned or allowed to grow into the surrounding plants. When it does climb it is most decorative amongst other bushes and trees. No reports on pests attacking these plants have been published nor have any pests been observed by the author. This plant is available from only a few nurseries that specialize in indigenous plants.",,,"The fruit are edible with a refreshing, tangy flavour and can be eaten either fresh or fried. Some say that it makes a good brandy, jelly or jam and even vinegar. The milky latex from members of this genus has been used as a source of good quality rubber.","Some authors say the fruit are both edible and poisonous, probably referring to the milky latex in the skin that is typically poisonous in most members of the Apocynaceae.",,,,
Pelargonium salmoneum,Pelargonium salmoneum,,"Pelargonium salmoneum is a bushy, evergreen shrublet of 400–800 mm tall. The terete branches are 4–5 mm thick. Initially very soft when young, but hardening as it ages. The leaves are yellowish green, with 15–40 mm long petioles, and broadly ovate to ovate-lanceolate stipules, 5–13 mm long and 4–7 mm broad.

The flowers are borne in flowerheads of 4–20 flowers, each with a pedicel of 28–30 mm long atop a peduncle that varies from 40 to 200 mm long. The sepals are lanceolate to oblong-lanceolate and 10–12 mm long. The petals are salmon-pink, the upper 2, or all of them, are often red-veined. The ovary is densely villous. Fruits are 40–4 mm long, with prominent, spreading, white or light grey hairs on the beak.

The flowering peak is from early winter to early summer. During midsummer flowering comes to a complete halt and only resumes again in late autumn.","The name Pelargonium is derived from the Greek word pelargos, meaning ‘stork’ because the rostrum of the schizocarp in Pelargonium is thought to resemble the bill of a stork. This explains the common name, stork’s bill. The specific epithet salmoneum is in reference to the salmon-pink petals the species exhibits.Pelargonium salmoneum was initially treated as an ornamental in the Port Elizabeth municipal garden. This description featured in the Kew Bulletin publication of 1932. Curtis’s Botanical Magazine published a more comprehensive description, accompanied by a colour illustration, in 1934.","Pelargonium salmoneum is related to P. zonale (L.) L.’Her., P. inquinans (L.) L.’Her. and P. acetosum (L.) L.’Her. An unnamed specimen (No 1294) at the National Herbarium in Pretoria, which was collected among rocks near Komgha by H.G. Flanagan in 1892, is the closest possible clue from where this species could have originated from. However, despite this particular specimen being closer related to P. salmoneum than any of the trio of P. zonale, P. inquinans and P. acetosum, the absence of field knowledge makes it impossible to assess for critical aspects, such as minor differences concerning the shape of the calyx or stem thickness.

The pelargonium family or Geraniaceae consists of 5 genera, of which the genus Pelargonium is one. The genus consists of approximately 250 species in southern Africa. Geraniaceae is a cosmopolitan family confined to temperate and tropical regions such as S, E and NE Africa, Australia, New Zealand, St Helena, Tristan da Cunha, Madagascar and Asia. Southern Africa, which is home to more than 80% of the species, is regarded as the global hotspot of Pelargonium. The highest diversity amongst members of this family is found in the Namaqualand region, and the western and southern Cape of South Africa.

The specific pollinator of Pelargonium salmoneum is not known. Butterflies and various types of bees, including carpenter bees, honey bees and bumble bees, are some of the insects that can be associated with pelargonium pollination.

In this genus, all seeds have a feathered, tail-like structure, which is coiled in a spiral arrangement. The tail enables the light seed to twist around in the wind and drills itself into the soil. This smooth action provides more seed with realistic opportunity to germinate successfully.",,"This species is generally propagated through the making of cuttings right through the year. Stem cuttings larger than 70 mm, can be cut below the node and treated with a rooting hormone. Place the cutting in prepared holes, which are just slightly bigger than the cutting stem, in a sterilized and well-draining, rooting medium, like coarse river sand. Transfer the cutting cuttings to a cold frame or an area with some shade. Roots normally develop within 3 to 4 weeks.

Sow seed in late summer or early autumn in a well-draining medium, use either compost or fine river sand, to cover the seed. Water seed gently with a very fine spray and take great care in ensuring that the medium does not get overwatered, but just stays moist.

Companion plants may include: Aloe pluridens, A. ferox, A. aborescens and A. speciosa, Pelargonium acetosum, P. reniforme, P. inquinans and P. ionidiflorum, Strelitzia reginae and S. juncea, Portulacaria afra, Tylecodon paniculatus, Cotyledon orbiculata, Curio crassulifolius and C. ficoides, Dovyalis caffra, Cussonia spicata and C. paniculata and Celtis africana.

Feed adult plants with 3:1:5, once in autumn, and supplement it with seaweed-based, liquid fertilizer application every 2 weeks during the growing season. Seedlings and rooted cuttings can also be treated with a liquid seaweed-based fertilizer.

Plants tend to become lanky after a while, and a good prune at least every second year will ensure plants maintain a nice full and bushy appearance. Cut it back by at least a third to half its size in late summer to early autumn. Where conditions allow for it, this species may become overgrown and actually starts scrambling over other species that are capable of withstanding its weight.

Plants will tolerate poor soil, but for an optimum performance opt for rich soil. At Kirstenbosch National Botanical Garden it performs equally well in compacted and well-drained soil.

Gasteria brachyphylla,Gasteria brachyphylla,,"Plants are 75-230 mm in diameter and have a short, decumbent to erect stem 25-230 mm high. They are prolific from the base, and form small clusters. The roots are succulent, up to 5 mm in diameter.

The leaves grow in two opposite rows and are 15-230 mm long 22-80 mm broad at the base and strap-shaped to rarely triangular-spear-shaped. The inner leaves are erect, becoming spreading. The upper surface is convex to flat and the lower surface is flat. The leaf epidermis (skin) is smooth and dark green; both surfaces have dense white spots arranged in obscure transverse bands; the margin is wavy, becoming continuous towards apex, leathery white and with small rounded teeth, the leaf ends are sharp to rounded, ending in a short sharp point. The juvenile leaves are strap-shapedand rough to the touch (asperulous), densely spotted and rounded at the end.

The inflorescence is a raceme, simple or with a pair of side branches, 200-900 (-1110) mm tall. The flower stalks (pedicels) are 5-7 mm long. The flowers (perianth) are 12-22 mm long, tubular, swollen at the base, thence constricted to a tube 3-4 mm in diameter; the swollen portion is pink, 5-7 mm in diameter; the flower tube is white with green striations. The stamens do not protrude. Flowering period: July-February, but mostly during September.

The fruiting capsule is oblong, 15-23 mm long, 7 mm broad and the flattish black seeds 3-4 mm long, 2-3 mm wide.","The specific Greek epithet 'brachyphylla ' means short-leaved (""brachy "" = abbreviated or short and ""phyllon "", leaf).Gasteria brachyphylla was most probably first collected by Oldenland on the Schrijver expedition in 1689 in the Willowmore district and introduced to the 'Amsterdam Medicyn Hof' during the late seventeenth century. It was first cultivated in England by Mr Miller in 1731 (Aiton 1789). Prince Salm Dyck named named it Aloe brachyphylla in 1840, which was transferred to Gasteria in 1992 (Van Jaarsveld 1992).This species has been featured on the front cover of Gasterias of South Africa (Van Jaarsveld 1994), as an illustration by the botanical artist, Elaphie Ward-Hilhorst.The var. bayeri was first collected in March 1932 by H. H. Bolus. It was named for Mr Bruce Bayer, former curator of the Karoo National Botanical Garden (Van Jaarsveld 1992).","Gasteria brachyphylla is closely related to G. disticha which grows in the Robertson Karoo and has a rough leaf surface (almost like fine sandpaper, termed asperulous). Although both have leaves in two opposite rows, the former is immediately recognized by its smooth often shiny texture. Gasteria brachyphylla is an attractive medium-sized Gasteria species.Two varieties of Gasteria brachyphylla are recognized (Van Jaarsveld 2007).The typical variety (var. brachyphylla ) has leaves 9 0-230 x 30-80 mm with a pointed leaf tip. It grows mainly in the Klein Karoo in Succulent Karoo vegetation (Eastern Little Karoo of the Rainshadow Valley Karoo Bioregion) and in Gamka Thicket of the Albany Thicket Biome (Mucina & Rutherford 2006). Most of the images on this page are of this variety.Gasteria brachyphylla var. bayeri is immediately distinguished from var. brachyphylla by its much smaller spreading leaves (leaves shorter than 50 mm) rounded at the point. This variety is only known from a few sites such as the hills surrounding Badspoort near Calitzdorp (Klein Karoo) and a site near Vanwyksdorp.Gasteria brachyphylla is widely distributed in the Klein Karoo, the low lying arid region between the Swartberg and Langeberg mountain ranges. It occurs from Barrydale in the west, to near Uniondale in the east, and northwards to the Willowmore district between the Baviaanskloof and Swartberg mountain ranges. It is found at elevations of up to 1 000 m. It occurs in flat to mountainous terrain usually in shade of dwarf shrubs interspersed with taller shrubs. It grows mainly on shales and sandstones of the Bokkeveld Group (Cape Supergroup) as well as quartzitic sandstones and shales of the Table Mountain and Witteberg Group (Cape Supergroup). It has also been found to a lesser extent on Cenozoic alluvium, Mesozoic conglomerates of the Uitenhage group (Enon Formation) and Namibian limestones of the Kango Group. The soils are sandy and well drained and the pH varies between 4,7 (in sandstone) and 7,6 (in shale). The climate is hot and dry and when frost occurs it is mild. Rainfall, ranging between 200 and 300 mm per year, occurs in summer and winter but with a tendency to summer dryness.",,"Gasteria brachyphylla often grows in shade of spiny karoo shrubs such as Carissa haematocarpa. The mottled greenish leaves are well camouflaged among the vegetation. The leaves become reddish brown tanned during drought and blend in with the natural surroundings. The flowers usually protrude above the shrubs where they are pollinated by sunbirds. Seeds ripen during summer. The capsules, when ripe, are held in an erect position and seeds are released by strong gusts of wind. The seeds are wind-dispersed. The succulent leaves and roots enable the plant to cope with the dry season and general dry conditions. Gasteria brachyphylla and most other Gasteria species have a vegetative propagation back-up: They are often eaten by animals. The leaves are brittle and, when leaf fragments drop to the ground after being eaten, they root and the portions sprout new offsets.

Plants are occasionally cultivated on rockeries or in containers.

Gasteria brachyphylla thrives in cultivation and does best as a pot plant or grown locally in rockeries in Succulent Karoo or Nama Karoo gardens. It is a slow grower. In other parts of the world it can also be grown out-of-doors, but is best cultivated in dry Mediterranean-type gardens where frost is not too severe (parts of California, USA, and the Mediterranean). Although it can be grown in full sun, plants prefer some slight shade, and in hot climates should therefore be protected from full sun. Plants should reach flowering size in about four years.

Euclea natalensis,Euclea natalensis,,"Euclea natalensis is a shrub or small bushy tree, 4-10 m tall, with a dense, spreading crown, or under warm and well-watered conditions, a medium-sized tree 12-18 m tall with spreading branches. It has a spread of 5-10 m. The trunk is usually straight. The bark is dark grey, thin and finely cracked. Branchlets are covered in fine rusty hairs, becoming smooth with age. The leaves are hard and leathery, dark green and shiny above and paler underneath.

The lower surface is often covered with thick, velvety red hairs, the upper surface is occasionally also covered with hairs. The leaves are variable in size, shape and hairiness, most often oval to oblong with pointed, bluntly pointed or rounded tips. The veins are prominent, particularly on the upper surface. The margins are thickened and often wavy. The new growth in spring is very decorative with pale, gold-tinged, velvety hairy foliage emerging out of the dark green crown.

Euclea natalensis is dioecious (with male and female flowers borne on separate trees). The flowers are small, bell-shaped, cream to yellow and are carried in many-flowered, branched sprays in the axils of the leaves. They have a heavy, sweet scent. The male flowers contain usually 16 stamens and a minute rudimentary ovary with 2 styles. The female flowers have no staminodes.

The fruits are rounded, fleshy berries, 7-13 mm in diameter, borne on hairy stalks. They are smooth or bristly, yellow, orange, red and black, in dense, conspicuous clusters. They are edible and attract birds.

The trees flower in winter-spring (June-October) and fruit during summer (August-March), ripening in autumn. The trees growing in Kirstenbosch do not set fruit as abundantly as trees in habitat, perhaps because the male and female specimens are planted too far apart from each other.","The genus name Euclea means of good report, or famous, from the Greek eucleia, glory which is derived from eu- good, and kleos report, perhaps referring to the good quality ebony-type wood of some species. The species name natalensis means from Natal, now KwaZulu-Natal.The common name guarri is the phonetic spelling of its original Khoisan name, the original meaning unknown. The Zulu name inkunzane is used to refer to a strong enema and inkunzemnyama the strong black enema.","Euclea natalensis is divided into six subspecies: subsp. angustifolia F.White, subsp. capensis F.White, subsp. magutensis F.White, subsp. natalensis, subsp. obovata F.White and subsp. rotundifolia F.White. Euclea natalensis is widespread, from Clanwilliam in the Western Cape, southwards and eastwards along the coast through the Eastern Cape to KwaZulu-Natal, Swaziland, Mozambique, Mpumalanga, Limpopo, Gauteng and further north to tropical east Africa into Ethiopia. It is found growing under many different conditions in a wide variety of habitats, from arid rocky scrub to dune bush, open grassveld, woodland, forest, forest margin, riverine fringes, bushveld and in swamps, from sea level to 1200 m. In arid scrub it is stunted, often less than a metre tall, while in forest or under favourable conditions it can form a handsome tree 12-18 m tall with spreading branches. Euclea is a small African genus of about 20 species, with 16 species in southern Africa. The genus belongs in the Ebenaceae, the Ebony Family, which contains only two genera; Diospyros and Euclea. Diospyros is a large genus of about 475 species that occur throughout the tropics and subtropics of both hemispheres, with about 94 species in Africa, and about 20 in southern Africa.",,"Grow Euclea natalensis in a warm position, in full sun or partial shade, with fertile soil and moderate to good water supply, particularly during the summer months. Protect from frost when young. Water generously during its first years to allow it to establish itself. This species is wind tolerant, and drought tolerant when established.

Euclea natalensis is relatively slow growing. It is suited to many different types of gardens, including windy coastal gardens, well-watered subtropical gardens as well as bushveld and woodland gardens. In an exposed, windy, coastal site it will form a low, rounded, bushy, stunted tree, whereas in a protected, well-watered garden it can be expected to grow into a handsome medium-sized, spreading tree.

Euclea natalensis is easy to grow from seed. Clean off the fleshy layer, sow in spring or summer in a well-drained seedling mix. Place in a warm position out of direct sun and keep moist. Transplant into individual pots after the first pair of true leaves has developed.

Propagate by cuttings in spring or summer while the tree is actively growing. Take sturdy, semi-hardwood heel cuttings from the previous year's growth. Place in a well-drained, well-aerated rooting medium, in multi-trays, under mist with bottom heat set at 24 °C.",,,"Euclea natalensis twigs are used for toothbrushes.

Crinum macowanii,Crinum macowanii,strongly sweet-scented,"Crinum macowanii is a deciduous, summer-growing bulb. The bulbs are large, 60-250mm in diameter, with perennial fleshy roots. The leaves are large, variable, up to 1m long and 20-200mm wide, bright green to bluish green, fleshy and strap-like with undulating margin.

The flowers are large, bell-shaped, strongly sweet-scented white lilies with dark pink stripes, produced in umbels of 5 to 25 flowers on the tip of a long stalk, up to 1.1m tall. Flowering season is early summer (October to December). The fruit is a capsule of 3-6 irregularly shaped large (±20mm diameter) smooth, pale green to silvery, fleshy seeds or occasionally up to 20 small seeds.

Crinum macowanii is often confused with C. bulbispermum, the Orange River Lily. An easy way to tell them apart is by the colour of their anthers: the anthers of C. macowanii are black, while those of C. bulbispermum are not.","The name of the genus Crinum is from the Greek krinon meaning lily. This species is named after Peter MacOwan (1830-1909), a British teacher who first studied chemistry, came to South Africa in 1862 to take up the post of principal at Shaw College in Grahamstown, then took up botany. He formed the South African Botanical Exchange Society to facilitate the supply of duplicate specimens for overseas collectors. He moved to Gill College, Somerset East in 1869, then moved to Cape Town in 1881 and was appointed director of the Cape Town Botanic Garden (it was established in 1848 where the Company Gardens are today, but failed) and curator of the Cape Government Herbarium and took up the chair of botany at the South African College (now the University of Cape Town). In 1892 he became Government Botanist and gave up the directorship and chair. He retired in 1905","Population numbers are declining. Crinum macowanii is still common but a decline in the number of wild plants has been observed. Bulbs are harvested and sold on medicinal plant markets.

Crinum macowanii is a variable and widespread species. It occurs in the Eastern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal, Free State, Mpumalanga, Gauteng, Limpopo and North-West, and in Namibia, Botswana, Angola, Zimbabwe, Swaziland, Mozambique and further northwards to east Africa.

It grows in many habitats, such as vleis, mountain grassland, seasonally flooded grassland, savanna, deciduous woodland, beside rivers and along the coast, and in various soils, such as gravely soil, shale or sandy flats. Crinum is a genus of between 60 and 100 species distributed in the tropics and temperate regions of Africa, Asia, Australia and America. The number is uncertain because crinums are particularly difficult to assess from dried herbarium specimens and are thus difficult to name correctly, e.g. field studies can reveal that what was thought to be one variable species is in fact a number of distinct species. There are 22 species recognised in southern Africa, where they are widespread in the summer-rainfall region.",,"This plant is fast growing and long-lived. It prefers a permanent spot where it will not be disturbed; constant digging up and moving damages its perennial roots and reduces flowering. It can be grown outdoors in mild parts of the Northern Hemisphere, but needs protection in very cold areas. It can be cultivated in a large container, but must be kept well watered and fertilised regularly.

Grow Crinum macowanii in full sun, in fertile soil. It needs regular heavy watering during its summer growing period and thrives in a moist position, e.g. beside a stream, river or pond or on the edges of a vlei and is ideal for wet parts of a garden. It prefers to be dry during its winter dormant period but will survive winter irrigation and/or rain provided the soil is very well drained. It is a heavy feeder and benefits from regular feeding and generous applications of well-rotted compost.

Propagate by seed or the removal of offsets. Crinum macowanii produces a large number of seeds and they germinate readily. Seed is perishable and must be sown as soon as it is ripe, in deep seed trays, in well-drained sandy soil enriched with compost and placed in a warm, sunny spot and kept moist. Seeds germinate in a week or two. Seed-grown plants should flower from their third year. Although Crinum macowanii does not form offsets readily, remove offsets after flowering or while the plant is dormant.

Watch out for the Amaryllis Lily Borer, and slugs and snails can cause damage.",,,"Crinum macowanii bulbs and leaves are used in traditional medicine in the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal and in many parts of Africa. Bulbs are used to treat kidney and bladder infections, tuberculosis, swelling of the body, scrofula, rheumatic fever, itchy rashes, sores, boils and acne, backache, venereal disease, to stimulate milk and to make protective charms. Leaves are used as poultices and bandages. The bulbs contain toxic alkaloids, and should be used with caution.",,,,,
Oldenburgia paradoxa,Oldenburgia paradoxa,,"Olenburgia paradoxa is a dwarf, cushion-forming shrublet, up to 0.3m in height, with short, thick woody branches. The pllants form cushions up to 1 m in diameter on rocky outcrops. Leaves are narrowly-elliptic, alternately arranged to form rosettes at ends of short branches. They are 10 - 50mm long, about 10mm wide, shiny, dark green, simple, leathery. The undersides are densely white-woolly and the leaves are silky at base, with edges rolled under.

The plants produce a number of single, stalkless, tan-coloured capitula (flower heads) that nestle in the cushion of leaves. Each capitulum is about 25mm in diameter with several rows of firm, woolly bracts and small white florets in each head. Plants flower from January to October with a peak in April.","The genus Oldenburgia was named in honour of F.P. Oldenburg, who accompanied Thunberg and Masson on some of their travels in the Cape in the early 1770s. The genus consists of four species that are endemic to the Cape Province.","Oldenburgia paradoxa grows in high altitude mountain fynbos in the south-western and southern Cape from Villiersdorp to Avontuur. Oldenburgia paradoxa grows on rocks of Table Mountain Sandstone, rooting in crevices and forming large cushions at 600 - 1300m altitude. It is a compact cremnophyte or cliff dweller with a strong root probing crevices to fix it securely to cliffs and rocky outcrops. The root zone is therefore restricted, well drained and acidic. Observations indicate that it is killed by fire, but some escape by habitat or survive partial burning. This species forms a very hard cushion and is not grazed.

Seed is released when flowers mature and each disc floret forms a small parachute, with the seed at the base, that can be distributed by wind. It appears not to colonise sandy soils on open slopes, which suggest that seeds need to land in a rocky crevice to germinate and survive to adult stage.

Oldenburgia grandis is pollinated by Cape sunbirds and it is therefore possible that they also pollinate Oldenburgia paradoxa.

Oldenburgia paradoxa is a novelty plant that will be of interest to specialist plant collectors or growers of alpine-like plants.",,"The seeds are then sown into a well-drained, acidic, potting mixture and lightly covered. Place seed in trays, plugs or individual pots and keep in a well-ventilated, warm, sunny position where the seeds are protected from rain. Sowing directly into plugs or pots minimizes root disturbance and maximizes the number of surviving seedlings. Do not over water and allow the medium to dry out a little between watering. The seeds should germinate within two months.

It is good practice to protect the seeds from rotting by treating them with a pre-emergence fungicide for preventing damping off. These fungicides are available at your local nursery. The seedlings should be carefully potted at cotyledon stage before the first pair of true leaves develop, as this species does not react well to disturbance. Choose the smallest pots or grow-plugs available and well-drained, acidic soil to mimic the natural crevice habitat to which it is adapted. A mixture of equal parts of well-rotted pine bark or fine compost and coarse river sand is recommended. The small plants should be fed every week or second week with an organic liquid fertiliser. The seedlings are slow growing and should be kept in the smallest possible container and only re-potted when it becomes root-bound and difficult to water.

Oldenburgia paradoxa form such a tight cushion that selection of cuttings is not recommended. They might root, however, removal of cuttings will destroy the aesthetic form of the plant. Plants in pots at Kirstenbosch have been divided and survive as long as some root is retained on each section.

Oldenburgia paradoxa is a recommended as a pot plant as a special collectors specimen. It is slow growing and long lived",,,,,,,,
Thamnochortus cinereus,Thamnochortus cinereus,,"Thamnochortus cinereus is a tufted plant with a fairly small diameter at the base of the plant, from which the stems fan out to form a rounded shape, about 1 m in height. The tall male inflorescences can reach a height of 1.5 m above the foliage. Members of the Restionaceae family do not have real leaves but the sterile branches at the nodes of the main stems look just like small, needle-like leaves. The plants can be treated like small shrubs or perennials and should reach an age of at least seven years if they are grown in a suitable spot. They normally start flowering during May or June in the southern hemisphere and the seed ripens during December. A two-year old plant can already be in flower and at three years old, the plants are at their decorative best.

",,"Thamnochortus cinereus grows in a wide range of conditionsin the coastal mountains of the southern part of South Africa from Port Elizabeth to Swellendam. It is one of the most common specieson the cooler south-facing slopes of the mountains, where the plants get a fair amount of rain or mist. The soils are mostly well drained but the plants also grow along streams or in seeps where the underground water runs. Although the plants can grow in fairly wet conditions, they would not be suitable for a bog garden or at the edge of a pond where the water is not moving underground. The plants mostly grow in full sun but can tolerate light shade during part of the day. They are not frost tolerant and require Mediterranean growing conditions, i.e. mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers. The genus Thamnochortus is quite large, there are approximately 31 species growing mostly in the southern part of South Africa. It is part of the family of Restionaceae, which is widespread throughout the southern hemisphere and can be found in places as far apart as Australia, Madagascar, Indo-China and Chile. The family name of Restionaceae refers to the Latin restis, which means cord or rope and alludes to the use of the plants in southern Africa. The species in this genus are mostly tufted plants, but some have creeping rhizomes with stems which pop up some distance from each other. The height varies considerably between species, some are only 300 mm high, whereas T. spicigerus and T.insignis can reach heights of 3 m with a diameter of also 3 m. T. insignis is the only member of the genus which is of considerable commercial value and is widely used for thatching roofs. The species name cinereus refers to the silvery colourof the female bracts. Like all restios, the male and female flowers are on separate plants. The flowers themselves are very small and insignificant; the silvery colouring is produced by the bracts, which surround the flowers. The plants are wind pollinated with the male inflorescences in small tassels swaying in the wind, while the female flowers are at the base of medium-sized bracts, which catch the pollen from the air and funnel it towards the small, fringed styles of the female flowers.





",,"The plants are best grown from seed, which has a fairly good germination rate when treated with smoke or 'Instant Smoke Plus' seed primer. It must be taken into account that about half of the seeds will not be viable, so the seed will have to be sown in an even layer, covering the soil in the seed pan. This species should be grown in full sun, in a well-drained soil and have plenty of air movement around it. The plants adapt to a large variety of soil types. The best time for planting restios is at the beginning of the rainy season, as the plants need regular watering during the first six weeks to two months after planting. After this initial period the plants can survive with a little additional watering but grow better with a normal garden-watering regime. They may be fed with standard organic fertilizers such as Seagro, Kelpak or Bounce Back, or by sprinkling the surrounding soil with a small amount of ammonium sulfate during the growing season.

The plants will initially be a bit slow to grow, but will have formed a handsome plant and flower three years after sowing. The plants produce a new growth flush in the centre of the plant every year. The individual stems start to deteriorate during the third year but by that time already two new flushes of growth will have appeared for the yearly renewal of the plant. This governs the maintenance of the plant, which really only needs a regular removal of the brown, dead stems on the outside part of the plant.",,,,,,,,
Agathosma cerefolium,Agathosma cerefolium,,"Agathosma cerefolium is a rounded, single-stemmed, aniseed-scented shrublet up to 1,4 m high.

The needle-like to rounded leaves are 3-5 mm long. They vary from slightly concave to convex above. The margins are hairy.

The tips of the branchlets bear clusters of pink, mauve or white flowers with 3-5 mm long petals and lance-shaped staminodes (sterile stamens). The ovary and fruits are 3-segmented. The flowering period is from August to January.","The genus name Agathosma is derived from the Greek word agathos which means good, and osme which refers to the distinctive fragrance which is so characteristic of the genus. The oil glands on the leaves and fruit normally release an aromatic fragrance when crushed. The specific epithet, cerefolium, refers to the waxy leaves of the specie",There are at present 150 species of Agathosma. The majority of them is confined to the Western Cape.,,"Autumn is the best time to sow the seed. Use a light, well-draining medium. For this plant, a mixture of equal parts sand and compost, or just plain coarse river sand, will do. Cover the seed with a thin layer of sand or bark, and then water. Keep the seed tray in a covered area that provides enough ventilation and good light. The medium must never be overwatered or be allowed to dry out. Germination takes between 4 and 9 weeks.

The seedlings can be pricked out when the first four true leaves appear. Move the potted plants to a shady area for 3-4 weeks to harden them off before placing them in the sun. This period is also the ideal time to pinch out the growing tips of the seedlings, to promote a more bushy growth habit. The young seedlings can now also be fed with some balanced nutrient products. These plants will be ready for transplanting into the garden after 8 to 9 months.

This buchu can also be propagated from cuttings. Take heel, tip or semi-hardwood cuttings from fresh material of the current year's growth. Take cuttings of between 25 and 55 mm length, remove about a third of the foliage and cut them below the node. The cuttings are then dipped in a rooting hormone and placed in trays with a medium consisting of equal parts of bark and polystyrene.

If available, place the cuttings in a mist unit with heated benches. If not available, place cuttings in a protective environment such as under waterproof sheeting. Ensure the cuttings are kept damp at all times. This could be done by using a fine sprayer or sealing the cuttings in a plastic bag. It normally takes 9-11 weeks for roots to develop. The rooted cuttings must ideally be hardened off for 2-3 weeks before potting up.

Pot the rooted cuttings into a well-draining mix and place them in a shady area to harden off. After 2-4 weeks they can be moved into full sun.

Agathosma cerefolium prefers full sun and a well-drained soil. The ideal time for planting is between autumn and winter during the rainy season. This affords plants the opportunity to establish themselves properly in the garden before they have to cope with the harsh weather conditions of summer.

Before planting commences, dig over the soil and, if required, add compost and a slow-release fertiliser.

Some companion plants which this buchu could be planted with include: Coleonema album, Acmadenia mundiana, Agathosma collina, Delosperma litorale, Jordaaniella dubia, Leucospermum patersonii, Protea susannae, Pelargonium betulinum, Lobelia valida and Chrysocoma coma-aurea.

Space plants 20-30 cm apart when planting. This should provide enough space to encourage growth. Buchus thrive when densely planted as this helps to retain soil moisture. Water the plants well after planting.

Regular mulching will also assist in keeping the soil and roots cool during summer.",,,,,,,,
Salvia schlechteri,Salvia schlechteri,,"Salvia schlechteri is a perennial shrub which can become woody at the base. The erect stems, up to 300 mm, are square as is typical of Lamiaceae, and may be branched. Leaves are a vibrant light green and deeply divided giving them a feathery appearance. Both stems and leaves are scattered with glandless hairs and oil globules although the plant is not particularly aromatic.

Pale mauve and white flowers appear during summer. Black or dark brown nutlets are visible at the base of the calyx and fall out when ripe. The Xobo Valley sage is a quick growing perennial, but has a semi-dormant period over winter.","Salvia schlechteri was first described in 1903 by a Swiss botanist, John Isaac Briquet (1870-1931). Briquet was the curator of the Conservatoire Botanique in Geneva. Salvia is derived from the Latin salvus, meaning uninjured, whole, safe, well or sound, and salvere, to be in good health, referring to the medicinal value of the plants. The appellation schlechteri honours its first collector, Friedrich Richard Rudolf Schlechter (1872-1925), who was a German botanist and taxonomist that travelled to Africa to do botanical explorations from 1892-1895. He collected the first herbarium specimen of Salvia schlechteri on 18 January 1895 in the Transkei. He collected widely and his collections are too numerous to list. His extensive herbarium in Berlin was destroyed in the 1945 bombing during the Second World War.","Salvia schlechteri requires further study to determine its conservation status and is currently Red Listed as data deficient (DDD). According to the SANBI Threatened Species Programme, it is likely to be threatened by overgrazing and expanding rural settlement. Too little is known about this species to determine its threat status accurately.

This species is only known from the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa. Minimal details are available about its locality and it is noted as occurring in the Xobo Valley of the former Transkei, growing in full sun in rich loamy soil of the grasslands. Salvia is the largest genus in the Lamiaceae family and consists of approximately 900 species made up of annuals, perennials and shrubs. They are widely distributed around the world in warm temperate and tropical regions. Twenty-seven species are found naturally in South Africa. Noteworthy South African sages are S. africana-lutea, S. africana-caerulea, S. chamelaeagnea, S. muirii and S. dolomitica. Sages are commonly grown as ornamentals.",,"Salvia schlechteri can be used as an attractive, summer-flowering shrub in any herbaceous border and is suitable for large or small gardens. This sage is a wonderful addition to any garden planting with its vibrant green foliage and pale blue flowers. As it occurs naturally in grasslands, it is best suited to dense plantings with other herbaceous perennials and grasses. It is suitable as a foreground or midway planting. When it goes dormant in winter, annuals or other seasonal herbaceous perennials can be grown in the same area reducing the open space left by its vacancy in the border planting. Salvia schlechteri is a wonderful garden specimen and water wise.

A hybrid between Salvia schlechteri and S. muirii is also in cultivation and it makes a wonderful display perennial which does not go fully dormant as does the pure species.

Salvia schlechteri is best grown in open ground in full sun. It requires well-drained, composted soils. This sage will survive with regular watering in summer. No extra feeding is necessary for strong, healthy growth in good soils, although an occasional foliar feed would do no harm and the plants will tolerate and respond well to general fertilizing. The plants can be pruned back, almost to the ground, every year when they go dormant.

Young plants can be planted out at the end of spring. Salvia schlechteri is easily combined with most flowering perennials or shrubs that contrast with its foliage, such as Diascia integerrima, Silene bellidioides and Lasiospermum bipinnatum.

New plants are easy to propagate from seed and cuttings. Sow seeds from late spring to early summer into a general potting soil mix. Seeds germinate quickly and seedlings can be transplanted into well-drained potting soil once the first pair of true leaves appears.

Take semi-hardwood tip cuttings in spring and summer. Cuttings must be without terminal flowering buds. Using a rooting hormone will improve the chance of root development. Place in a rooting medium consisting of 50% fine-milled bark or peat and 50% perlite. Keep cuttings under mist or enclose in plastic bags to retain humidity. Keep warm but out of direct sunlight. Cuttings should root in 3-6 weeks.

The plants do not have any major pests. Mealy bug and aphids do appear from time to time, but are easily managed with suitable control methods.",,,,,,,,
Erica clavisepala,Erica clavisepala,,"Erica clavisepala is a compact, bushy shrublet reaching only 300 mm in height. The whole plant is covered with light greyish gland-tipped hairs, giving it a distinctive frosted look and making it a bit sticky to the touch. The leaves are dark green, tiny, covered in the gland-tipped hairs, and carried in groups of four up the stem.

The flowers are dark purplish pink and are presented in dense heads of 6-20 flowers during late summer to autumn (February-April). The corolla is small (3 mm long) and urn-shaped. The bracts and sepals are long and thin and covered in long, shaggy hairs.","The genus Erica gets its name from the Greek word ereiko, to break, either because of the ability of the plant to break up bladder stones or more probably because the stems are brittle and break easily. This species is so named because its sepals are slightly club-shaped, from the Latin clava, meaning club.","Erica clavisepala is Rare, meaning that it has a small natural population and a small distribution range. It consists of less than 20 000 individual plants and occurs over 45 square kilometers. Rare species are at risk from sudden or unexpected changes to their habitat in that a single event could wipe out the whole species. However, this heath is protected within the Table Mountain National Park and is not threatened.

Erica clavisepala is endemic to the Cape Peninsula where it is confined within the Cape Point section of the Table Mountain National Park. It grows in sandy, peaty marshes and seeps on flats at low altitude and is frequent where it does occur. In the field, this heath is quite inconspicuous, due to its short stature, dark green leaves and dark purple flowers.",,"Grow Erica clavisepala in well-drained soil, in a sunny position. It prefers a well-watered site, but it must be well-drained. Grow it in the fynbos garden, gardens on the coast or on the sandy flats, in the rockery, on terraces, or in containers. When growing ericas in containers, it is important to use the correct soil. It should be a well-drained, acidic (pH between 5 and 6.5), sandy loam, containing 50% well rotted compost, with no manure or strong fertiliser (use slow release or low doses).

Propagate by seed or cuttings. Sow in late summer to autumn (March-May), in well-drained sandy soil. Keep warm and moist. Treatment with Instant Smoke Plus Seed Primer will enhance germination. Use a well-drained, acidic medium. Because the seed is so fine it needs only a light covering of clean sand, or the seeds can be mixed with dry sand and the layer of seed and sand spread in a thin layer on top of the sowing medium. Water with a fine rose to avoid displacing the seeds. Keep the trays damp but not wet and out of direct sun in a warm, but not hot, situation. Germination takes 1 to 2 months. Transplant the seedlings when they are about 10 mm high. Grow on in light shade until they are established.

Take semi-hardwood heel cuttings in late summer, autumn or spring. Treat with a rooting hormone suitable for semi-hardwood cuttings. Place in well-aerated medium, under mist on heated benches ( 24°C). Pot the rooted cuttings in a well-drained, acidic soil medium and harden off in light shade for a month or two.",,,,,,,,
Nuxia floribunda,Nuxia floribunda,sweetly scented,"Nuxia floribunda is a small to medium-sized tree, usually 3 m to 10 m tall, although heights of up to 25 m may be attained. The main stem is often somewhat contorted and up to 600 mm in diameter. The fissured bark is rough and flaking and is grey to brown in colour. A lovely dense and rounded crown is often evident, contributing greatly to the visual appeal of the species.

The branchlets are angular and purplish, becoming paler with age. They may be smooth or finely hairy and prominent leaf scars are usually evident along their length. The leaves are simple, 40-160 x 10-70 mm, oblong to elliptic in shape, and taper to a pointed apex.

They may be opposite but more often are 3-whorled and this, together with the distinctive red to purple midrib visible on immature leaves, represents a valuable identification feature of the tree. The leaf margins are entire or faintly toothed and are often clearly undulating. The slender leaf stalks vary from 15 to 45 mm in length.

The sweetly scented, cream-white flowers are small in size, around 3 mm long, and are borne in large, branched inflorescences (cymose panicles) produced terminally and in the axils of leaves nearer the ends of the branches. Bracts are around 1 mm in length and both the calyx and corolla are 4-lobed, the stamens protruding. Flowering has been recorded from autumn to spring, mostly between the months of May and September.

The fruit is an ovoid capsule that protrudes slightly from the persistent calyx and splits into 4 lobes, revealing numerous tiny seeds. N. floribunda can be readily distinguished from other members of the genus by its large, striking inflorescences.","The genus Nuxia was named in honour of M. de la Nux, a French amateur botanist on Reunion Island, and the species name floribunda translates as many-flowered or flowering profusely, in reference to the floriferous nature of the tree. The very descriptive Zulu name umHlambandlazi literally means mousebird-washer (Palmer & Pitman 1972).","The natural distribution of the species extends from the Cape midlands and Eastern Cape through Kwazulu-Natal, Mpumalanga and Limpopo province to Mozambique and up into eastern and central tropical Africa. It is fairly widespread in forests and on forest margins in the coastal and mountain forest belt, occurring frequently along watercourses (Von Breitenbach 1965). It is relatively sensitive to frost and drought which effectively excludes it from the very cold or arid regions. Cultivation of this species however is now commonplace outside of its natural range.

The genus Nuxia is found from South Africa to Arabia including Madagascar, the Comores and Mascarene Islands. It is a small genus with around 20 species in all, five of which occur in southern Africa. It is comprised of trees and shrubs with bark that is fibrous and stringy. Leaves are in whorls of three, but occasionally are opposite and rarely alternate in their arrangement, and the flowers which are bisexual are borne in terminal or axillary inflorescences. Another species occasionally cultivated is N. oppositifolia.

Nuxia previously formed part of the family Loganiaceae, which was a fairly large family of trees, shrubs and climbers, comprising approximately 600 species in 29 genera, spread across various temperate, subtropical and tropical regions of the world (Allaby 1998). Nuxia together with genus Buddleja and Gomphostigma, were moved to the family Buddlejaceae, and now recent molecular studies have resulted in Nuxia being moved again to the Stilbaceae, where it now resides.",,"N. floribunda can be successfully grown from either seed or vegetatively from cuttings. Propagation from cuttings involves selecting healthy semi-hardwood or hardwood cuttings up to 100 mm in length (Venter & Venter 2002). These should be inserted into a well-drained growing medium for rooting, suitable media being river sand or equal parts of river sand and compost mix, this latter medium being suitable also for the sowing of seed. The seeds which are very small in size should be scattered evenly over the surface of the medium and very lightly covered with fine river sand. Place in a warm, brightly lit position and keep moist. Germination times generally vary between 6 and 12 weeks. According to Von Breitenbach (1965) the germinative capacity of the seed may however be very low. This species will enjoy a moist, sunny to partly-shady position in the garden but as mentioned previously is not suited to frost-prone areas. In addition, its root system is not aggressive or invasive, allowing for planting in close proximity to roads, buildings and paving (Venter & Venter 2002). Plant in deep soil with plenty of compost. Given these favourable conditions, N. floribunda is a medium to fast grower. Its very attractive nature makes it a winner in most gardens where its lovely presence is sure to be felt.",,,"The forest elder has a number of useful attributes. As a traditional Zulu medicine the bark is used as a strengthening medicine after a kraal (village) member has passed away, while in other parts of Africa the leaves are recorded being used to treat coughs, colds, influenza, fevers, indigestion, infantile convulsions as well as in rituals (Hutchings et al. 1996). Nectar is produced in abundance making this a good honey tree (Venter & Venter 2002).",,,,,
"Rotheca louwalbertsii
","Rotheca louwalbertsii
",,"Rotheca louwalbertsii is a perennial herb with many erect, unbranched or sparsely branched, angular, annual stems arising from a woody, underground rootstock. The glabrous or pilose annual stems are usually up to 0.5 m, rarely up to 0.8 m tall. The leaves are arranged in threes (ternate), opposite or sometimes in whorls of 4, sessile or subsessile, glabrous or pilose; blade linear to narrowly elliptic, decreasing in size upwards. The apex of the leaves is acute, the base cuneate and the margin is entire. The leaf surfaces are dotted with numerous peltate hairs.

Flowering has been recorded from October to March (May). The stems culminate in long, drawn-out inflorescences with the leaves gradually decreasing to bracts supporting the peduncles. The peduncles are also arranged in threes, one in the axil of each bract. The lower peduncles are the longest and often branched, bearing up to three flowers (dichasium/cyme), whereas the upper peduncles are shorter and mostly one-flowered. The whole compound inflorescence structure is known as a thyrse.

The calyx is green but often tinged purplish, fused to about halfway and with five free calyx lobes. The corolla appears as a ball on a short tube, opening up as a bilaterally symmetrical (zygomorphic) unit consisting of a short tube, four lateral lobes (two on each side) and a lower lip. The four lateral petals are pale purplish while the lower lip is dark purple marked with a white inverted Y-shaped pattern. Four stamens and the style, all purple, are inserted in the corolla throat, opposite the lower lip, long exserted and curved towards the lower lip. The stigma consists of two unequal lobes. The superior ovary is 4-lobed in the upper part. Only one or two, rarely three or four, of these lobes develop further into small, elongated, elliptic or oblong fruits (1- to 4-lobed drupe), much smaller than the elliptic to roundish black fruits of the sister species, R. hirsuta (= Clerodendrum triphyllum). The calyx is persistent in the fruiting stage.","The earliest valid and available name for a group of previously named Clerodendrum species was established as Rotheca by Rafinesque in 1836, who derived it from Latinising two Malaysian names, cheriya, meaning small, and thekku, meaning teak.

The species name louwalbertsii was chosen in honour of Dr Louw Alberts, a well-known South African scientist and Christian. He held a Doctorate in Physics and was awarded three honorary doctorates. He was inter alia vice president of the then Atomic Energy Board, Director-General of the Department of Mineral and Energy Affairs, chairman of the board of the CSIR, and chairman of the Suid-Afrikaanse Akademie vir Wetenskap en Kuns (an academy for science and art). He played a leading role in the peace initiatives during the 1990s. His philosophy about science and religion: 'To me, the written word (the Bible) and the created word (natural science) have the same author - God - and a wonderful harmony exists between the two'.","The genus Rotheca comprises about 30 species in the sub-Saharan region of Africa, with one species in tropical Asia, eastwards to the Molucca Islands, and one species introduced and naturalised in Madagascar and the Indian Ocean Islands (Fernandes 2005). About nine species are known from southern Africa.

Rotheca louwalbertsii was for a long time confused, misidentified and included in R. hirsuta (= Clerodendrum triphyllum ). Specimens of this taxon were already collected by Zeyher on the Magaliesberg, but it was only described as new in 1995 as Clerodendrum louwalbertsii ( Herman 1995). Based on certain morphological and molecular studies, some Clerodendrum species were transferred to Rotheca, which necessitated the new combination ( Herman & Retief 2002).

The genera Rotheca and Clerodendrum are distinguished as follows: in Rotheca, the flower buds are markedly asymmetrical, the corolla expanding abruptly on the lower side only, and the anterior corolla lobe is frequently much larger than the other four corolla lobes. The anthers are basifixed, and the stigma lobes are unequal. In Clerodendrum, the flower buds are symmetrical or, if asymmetrical, usually expanding abruptly on the upper side due to resupination (the flower buds turn upside down because the pedicels (flower stalks) are twisted through 180º), the anterior corolla lobe is only slightly (if at all) larger than the other corolla lobes, the anthers are versatile, and the stigma lobes are equal.

R. louwalbertsii can be distinguished from R. hirsuta by the long, drawn-out terminal inflorescences (thyrsoid inflorescence) and the linear leaves. In R. hirsuta the flowers are arranged in cymes in the axils of the lower leaves and the leaves range from narrowly obovate to obovate to elliptic.

The white, inverted Y-shaped pattern on the purple lower corolla lip and the long exserted, curved stamens and style of R. louwalbertsii are adaptations to insect pollination. The underground rootstock is an adaptation for survival of unfavourable conditions such as the cold, dry winters of the Highveld, and veld fires.",,"As in the case of Rotheca hirsuta, R. louwalbertsii is not in general cultivation, presenting a challenge to the keen gardener to create an environment to suit it.",,,,,,,,
Elephantorrhiza elephantina,Elephantorrhiza elephantina,,"Perennial suffrutex producing unbranched, unarmed, aerial stems up to 0.9 m high. These stems represent the canopy of the much larger tree which is below ground. The bark and young branchlets are dark reddish brown. The leaves are dull green, bipinnately compound with 2 -17 opposite or subopposite pairs of pinnae. Flowers are arranged in axillary, solitary or clustered racemes that are golden yellow to pale yellowish white and near to or protruding from ground level. Flowering time is from September to November and does not rely on spring rain. Fruits are dark or reddish-brown compressed pods with the valves separating from the persistent margins when they open. Seeds are ellipsoid and dark brown. The suffrutescent habit of E. elephantina can be explained as an adaptation to the environment , a trait that a plant evolved deliberately in order to survive certain environmental constraints. The main ecological driving forces behind the development of this extraordinary habit are frost and fire throughout the species' natural distribution. Herbaceous plants are commonly believed to have been derived from more ancient woody forms through reduction and simplification. Therefore, the suffrutescent habit may also be viewed (from a geological time scale point of view) as something like an intermediate form where the climatic cooling in the Tertiary period effectively stunted woody plants until their aerial parts persisted for no more than a single growing season. This happened over such a long period that plants had more than enough time to gradually adapt to changing environmental conditions.

According to the latest Red List, E. elephantina falls within the Least Concern category as it's a widely distributed species occurring in many bioregions throughout southern Africa. However, it is important to note that when a population of E. elephantina is destroyed the chance of regeneration is extremely limited as they are known to grow in relatively intact natural areas. They are not weedy in character even though a large colony of these plants may seem so.","The generic name Elephantorrhiza was first published in 1841 by Bentham after other authors had placed it within the genus Acacia (Burchell and De Candolle) or in Prosopis (De Candolle, Sprengel and Meyer). Bentham founded the genus on E. elephantina, the first member of this genus that was discovered by Burchell during his travels into the interior of the country. Burchell first called this strange new plant Acacia elephantina noting the enlarged underground parts.

Elephantorrhiza is a Greek compound meaning 'elephant root' in reference to the large roots of E. elephantina.","Of all species of Elephantorrhiza, E. elephantina is the most widespread and most commonly encountered from the southern parts of Angola, Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Mozambique and the South African provinces of Limpopo, Northwest, Gauteng, Mpumalanga, Free State, KwaZulu-Natal, Northern Cape and Eastern Cape as well as Swaziland and Lesotho. The distribution range of this species is extensive and populations vary considerably with regards to the number of pinnae pairs and the number, size and shape of the leaflets. However, this variation is continuous and genetic which means that no infraspecific groups/taxa can be satisfactorily distinguished.

The genus Elephantorrhiza is an exclusively African genus and consists of nine species with several infraspecific taxa. Their habitats include almost all major biomes south of the equator. As a group, they are fairly homogeneous. The closest related genus is Entada which includes the well known Snuff Box Sea Bean (Entada rheedii) and together they form the Entada -group within the Mimosoideae subfamily of the Fabaceae or Leguminosae.",,"Since E. elephantina is not a garden plant, it is unclear (but doubtful) if anybody has ever tried to cultivate it for the commercial horticultural market. Experiments with seeds of this species have yielded very interesting evidence of a very unusual type of germination where the seedling buries its plumule (the bud within the embryo from which the stem and leaves develop) and shoots, thus arising from well below the ground surface. This is probably another adaptation by the plant to lower seedling mortality in an environment where veld fires are common.

Since the seeds ripen in summer it is advised that they be sown in late summer to autumn to simulate natural conditions. The exocarp (outer layer) of the pods breaks up fairly easily when they become wet and the seeds can often be seen germinating on the ground within the soft, disintegrating pods. Therefore the seeds may be sown whenever pods start to break up and no measures to break dormancy need to be taken. From the limited experiments on seed germination it seems that E. elephantina grows rather slowly and it won't be a quick fix for a garden in need of a ground cover. The best way to enjoy E. elephantina is still out in the unspoilt grasslands and savannas of southern Africa.",,,"The most commonly mentioned use for E. elephantina is for the tanning of leather. Xhosa and Zulu medicinal application of the plant includes using the root as a remedy for dysentery and diarrhoea, stopping bleeding, treating intestinal disorders, haemorrhoids, heart ailments and syphilis. It has also been used as an aphrodisiac, and a decoction from it has been used as a remedy for bovine and equine diarrhoea. An extract of the fleshy underground parts of the plant is used to treat sunburn. Roasted, the seeds have sometimes been used as a coffee substitute, although reportedly it is an acquired taste. Otherwise the seeds are toxic to several animals, including humans.

Some taboos are also associated with it, such as a Shangaan tradition which dictates that if the remaining root system of E. elephantina is not covered after a portion has been removed, the patients treated with it will not get better. In a very wide sense this may be interpreted as a means to prevent the over-harvesting of plant material, thus aiding conservation efforts, albeit in a somewhat unconventional way.",,,,,
Silene undulata,Silene undulata,fragrant,"Silene undulata is a sticky, glandular, perennial herb up to 60 cm tall. The opposite spatula-shaped basal leaves are up to 15 cm long and the smaller lance-shaped leaves on the stem up to 8 cm long. The flowers at the tip of the stems are glandular and sticky. The spreading petals are white or pinkish. Anthers are on slender paired filaments. The narrow ovary is oblong-ovoid, 1-locular, on a hairy stalk up to 7·5 mm long; the styles, 1,5 cm long, are slender and papillate along one side. The capsule, up to 1.8 cm long, opens by recurved valves at the tip. Seeds are almost black and kidney-shaped with flattened sides.","Silene comes from the Greek word sialon meaning saliva, referring to the sticky stems.",outhern and tropical Africa on damp slopes and flats.,,"According to Lorraine Solomon, owner of Kumbula Nursery in Bathurst, Silene undulata produces seed very freely and can easily become invasive if not checked. The small grey seeds, which look like gunpowder, are held in an urn-like capsule which opens at the top when ripe and are dispersed when the flower stems blow in the wind. It is said that Silene undulata is tolerant of extreme heat (+40°C) and extreme cold and even snow, when grown in the USA. The seeds are easily grown, but only on well-drained soil. They should be sown in autumn or spring in a seed box or open ground and kept slightly moist. When the young plants are about 5 cm tall they can be planted into position or thinned out. Compost should be added if the soil is very sandy.

Silene undulata appears messy in a garden bed or formal situation but is a delightful sight on dull days and evenings when the flowers open. They are very fragrant, particularly in the evening. Growth habit is lax and the many dead flower stems need to be cut away at the end of the flowering season. ",,,"Plants have been used worldwide for thousands of years by diviners and shaman to induce states of lucid dreaming in order to receive divinatory messages. Such sacred plants are classified as oneirogens, from the Greek oneiros meaning dream, and gen meaning to create. For amaXhosa people dreams are considered to be a means of direct communication between the living and the ancestors, and dreams are closely integrated into traditional healing practices. Good dreams are considered to be those directly connected with the ancestors while bad dreams as being sent by someone who wishes to harm the dreamer. A number of plants, collectively called izilawu and singly as ubulawu, are used in various ways to facilitate communication with the ancestors (iminyanya - referred to as shades in early literature), most often but not exclusively, during religious rituals. Ritual purity is essential for communication with the ancestors and can be achieved by washing with ubulawu plants. The foam-producing roots are crushed or grated, added to a billycan of cold water, and whisked rapidly using a forked stick that, according to custom is carved from a wild olive branch, until a head of frothy white foam is produced. Close attention is paid to the way the ubulawu foams. A lack of foam is interpreted as either incorrect timing for the ritual or the disapproval of the ancestors. This foam, called isilawu , is used as a face- and body-wash or ingested. Silene undulata is the most commonly used ubulawu plant in the Eastern Cape. The roots are harvested from wild populations and sold at informal street markets and iikemisti ( muthi shops). The trade of this species and many others has raised concern over their sustainable use and conservation status.",,,,,
Thamnochortus spicigerus,Thamnochortus spicigerus,,"Thamnochortus spicigerus is a giant, wide, unbranched restio, up to 2 m in height, with a base and crown diameter of 1–4 m, with well-developed rhizomes. The culms (stems) are unbranched, stout, and often with a slight curve, 5–20 mm apart, with a diameter of 4–8 mm.

The male inflorescence is similar to the female inflorescence, often more than 100 mm in length, with many spikelets and small spathe, 17–30 mm long. The male spikelet is pendulous (erect when young), dark brown with many flowers. Female spikelets are stiffly erect, egg-shaped, dark brown and with many flowers. Bracts for male and female are papery and much longer than the flowers.

Small brown flowers appear within the inflorescencein winter, from June to August.

Fruit is a nutlet, shed with the perianth attached; the winged sepals aid in wind dispersal of the fruit. The brown winged seeds, ± 1.77 mm in diameter, are released in early summer (November).","The genus Thamnochortus originates from the Greek words, thamno, meaning ‘bush’, and chortus meaning ‘green herbage’. The Latin word spicigerus means ‘bearing flower spikes’, a reference to their large inflorescences.","Thamnochortus spicigerus is found on deep sand of the West Coast and on the Cape Flats north of False Bay, 1–130 m above sea level. Its distribution covers an area from Langebaan, Malmesbury to Cape Point. It is typically a strandveld species, and is common on sand flats. Growing conditions include well-drained, alkaline coastal sand, with most rain falling in winter.

The Restionaceae family contains about 28 genera and 400 species. Members of the Restionaceae family are largely confined to the southern hemisphere. There are about 33 species of Thamnochortus with most of them occurring in the Cape Floristic Region, and a few in the Eastern Cape. Restionaceae comes from Latin word, restis, meaning ‘a rope’ or ‘cord’, alluding to the use of the plant.",,"Propagate Thamnochortus spicigerus by seed or vegetatively by division. Plants grown from division will take up to a year to grow, and do not look as vigorous as plants raised from seed.

Sow seeds in autumn, when the days are still warm, between 20–25°C and the nights are cool, between 8–10°C. Seeds require smoke treatment in a smoke tent for 30 minutes or soaked in a smoke water solution before sowing, in order to enhance their germination. Sow seeds into a seed tray using a sowing medium consisting of 1 part bark and 2 parts sand; firm down and cover with a layer of milled bark and water lightly. Keep the trays damp, and place them in a warm light area. Germination could be erratic but should begin after three to four weeks, and after six to eight weeks seedlings can be pricked out into 6 packs or larger containers using a well-drained fynbos mix.

Divide Thamnochortus spicigerus just before the crop of the new shoot emerges from the ground, in early or midwinter, from May to August. The plant should be divided into fairly large pieces. Care should be taken for the roots not to be disturbed, and plant out immediately in the ground or in containers. Keep the plant well watered after transplanting, until the new shoots are growing. Plants will take up to a year to grow and be ready for planting in the garden.

Thamnochortus spicigerus is best suited to fynbos gardens that have a well-drained soil, and grows in deep sand on the coastal foreland in the wild. The plant should be planted in a sunny position with good air circulation. Do not plant very close to a wall.

Before planting apply well-rotted compost to the soil. The best time to plant in the garden is at the beginning of the rainy season (May to August), so that the plants can be established before the dry, hot, windy summer arrives or water regularly during the first three months after planting. Once they are growing well, they need very little water. Plant in groups of four or more with other fynbos plants, to create a spectacular display. Good companion plants will include Erica multumbellifera, Protea burchellii, Helichrysum cymosum and Geranium incanum.

Thamnochortus spicigerus is relatively free from pests and diseases in the garden. It is subject to damping off as seedlings, if it is over watered, or if there is little or no air movement.",,,,,,,,
Erica recurvata,Erica recurvata,,"Erica recurvata is a small shrub growing of 0.3-0.6m in ideal conditions. In nature, it has only been found tucked into rock crevices, and what are thought to be very old individuals, have a bonsai-like appearance. The plants are branched and the stems are covered with whorled, pale-green, linear, ericoid leaves.

At the tips of branches, leaves encircle a drooping cluster of white and brown flowers with bright red styles that protrude beyond the petals. The flowers are about the size of a thumbnail, slightly sticky and appear in the winter months.

Erica recurvata is Red Listed as Critically Endangered. Not only are there very few individuals known, but its habitat and immediate surroundings are scattered with alien invasive plants and have been burned frequently. It is thought that the existing plants have survived these frequent fires by being protected within rocky outcrops.","For 200 years, Erica recurvata , so named for its recurved leaves, was known only from a painting in Andrews' Coloured Engravings of Heaths published between 1794 and 1830. It was thought that the paintings were of a hybrid developed at Kew Gardens, until living specimens, growing naturally in the Napier Mountains were discovered by Ross Turner. Ted Oliver recognised it as the Erica in Andrews' painting, and speculated that the plant was grown from seed collected in the late 1700s to early 1800s and sent to England by James Nivens (1776-1827), an early plant collector in the Cape. The seed was grown to flowering stage from which the botanical drawings were made and specimens taken and stored at Kew and other United Kingdom herbaria. It is thought that the plants found in the Napier Mountains, could be the very same plants from which this seed was collected.","Erica recurvata was (re)discovered in the Napier Mountains in the Western Cape, South Africa. Although their preferred habitat is Overberg Sandstone Fynbos, the plants have only been found in rocky outcrops where they grow wedged in clefts in the rocks.

The genus Erica belongs to the family Ericaceae, which is one of the distinctive and the largest genera comprising the South African fynbos flora. About 760 of the 860 Erica species occur in South Africa. Most Erica species have so-called ericoid or needle-like leaves with a narrow channel beneath which are borne in whorls around the stems. Flowers vary in size depending on species and petals are fused to form a corolla tube either narrow, or open and bell-shaped. Ericas grow naturally in many different habitats from coastal flats, marshes and rivers, to mountain peaks. The fruit is usually a loculicidal capsule (a capsule that dehisces by splitting down the middle of the locules) but can be an indehiscent capsule, drupe, achene or berry. Erica seed is extremely small and fine, and in all species, except for Erica sessiliflora , they are shed after ripening.",,"Erica recurvata has been successfully propagated by seed and cuttings. Collect the seed just as it starts to fall naturally and sow in autumn. Of all Erica species that have been tested for germination response to smoke treatment, 66% showed improved germination. It would therefore be advantageous to pre-soak E. recurvata seeds in an aqueous smoke extract or seed primer for 24 hours before sowing.

Use a well-drained, acidic sowing medium and firm down the surface of the medium. To prevent damping off, sow seeds evenly by mixing it with fine sand prior to sowing. A thin layer of propagation medium can be sieved over the seeds. Water the seeds with a very fine hose to prevent dislodging them and place containers under cover in a shade house until the seeds germinate.

Take cuttings from healthy, disease free plants about two months after flowering. At this stage, the plants would have grown shoots that are semi-hard. Nodal cuttings can be used, although heel-cuttings are most suitable. Carefully remove the leaves on the lower third, dip the cuttings into a rooting hormone and insert into a cutting medium of one part milled bark and one part polystyrene. Place the cuttings in a greenhouse with intermittent mist or in an open air mist spraying unit. Erica cuttings require good air circulation. When the cuttings have rooted well, they can be planted into pots in the same growing medium as for seedlings.

When the seedlings are 10mm tall and the cuttings are well established, they can be placed in an open, but lightly shaded area. Ericas require good air circulation at all times. When seedlings are 20-50mm in height, prick them out and plant into pots or plant bags. Ericas have very sensitive hair-like roots situated close to the surface of the medium and disturbance of these roots should be minimal. Like the propagation medium, the potting soil should be well-drained and acidic. A sandy loam with 50% humus, a pH of between 5 and 5.5, and low levels of phosphate is recommended. Three parts sand, two parts leaf mould/bark and one part soil can also be used. A mulch consisting of untreated woodchips, pine needles or stones can be placed around the plant on the surface of the potting medium to protect the delicate roots, keep them moist and cool, and to suppress weed growth. Once the plants are established, they can be moved out into the open. Water the plants well every second or third day, preferably in the mornings to prevent fungal infections from developing on the leaves. Fertilise with organic liquid fertilisers such as those derived from seaweeds, or a controlled-release granular fertiliser that is low in phosphate.",,,,,,,,
Erica blenna var. grandiflora,Erica blenna var. grandiflora,,"Erica blenna var. grandiflora is a tall, erect, woody shrub, 1.2-1.5 m high. It usually produces a single thin woody stem with few side branches. The leaves and flowers are borne on short side branches at or near the top of the stem. The bark is greyish brown and its deep-green leaves are neatly arranged around the stem. The leaves point upwards and are slightly curved at their ends.

Only a few large inflated, urn-shaped flowers are borne at the tips of branches. The flowers are bright orange with green tips and are sticky. Flowering time is from April to November. Seeds are small and develop in small capsules in the ovary.

It is found in two forms or variations: the smaller-flowered E. blenna var. blenna, which is more common and is a smaller shrub; E. blenna var. grandiflora with its strikingly beautiful large flowers is far better known, as it is more commonly photographed and featured in books. It is relatively short-lived, but mature specimens seen in habitat are estimated to be over 10 years old.","Erica blenna derives its name from the Greek word blennos, which means mucous, referring to its sticky flowers.","Erica blenna occurs in mountain reserves and is therefore well protected. It is, however, a slow-growing, woody species and therefore susceptible to too frequent fires. If its habitat burns too frequently it will not be able to recover fast enough to produce seed before the next burn and this could reduce its population.

Erica blenna var. grandiflora is found on the lower, southern slopes of the Langeberg Mountain Range between Heidelberg and Riversdale. It grows in relatively moist mountain fynbos closely associated with other medium-sized, moisture-loving shrubs such as brunias. It has been successfully grown for many years, but needs a protected position. It is best grown in gardens in winter rainfall areas. It is not frost tolerant and must be well watered through the summer. It should be able to tolerate temperatures ranging from about 10-30 ºC. Higher and lower temperatures may be tolerated for short periods. Erica blenna var. blenna occurs between Swellendam and Riversdale and is also a smaller shrub.",,"This species should rather be grown as a pot plant where its needs can be better catered for. This means that the pot plant can be placed in a cool, well-lit position and the plant's feeding and watering better controlled.

It can also be planted in gardens where it receives good ventilation, preferably a cool breeze. It does not do as well when planted in isolation where it has shown stress symptoms such as yellowing leaves and dieback of branches. It is recommended that this species be placed in rockeries on sloping ground and planted with other fynbos plants for support and protection. Companion plants may include other ericas, buchus, brunias, and restios.

It is propagated vegetatively by rooting fresh semi-hardwood tip or heel cuttings. Cuttings are rooted in multi-trays on heated benches under mist spray. Cuttings are rooted in autumn or spring in a rooting medium of equal parts bark and polystyrene chips. A semi-hardwood rooting hormone is used to aid the rooting process.

It germinates easily from seed sown in well-drained, acidic, sandy soil and when subjected to smoke treatment. Seed is normally sown from late summer into autumn, i.e. March to May.

The fynbos planting medium is made up of a combination of equal parts composted pine bark or pine needles and river sand. A little (20%) loam may also be added.

Regular pruning is recommended to keep the plants well branched and compact. Plants that are pruned look better, last longer and produce more flowers.

This Erica is adapted to living in poor soils but may be regularly fed with diluted organic liquid or small amounts of organic pellet fertilizers.",,,,,,,,
Chaenostoma hispidum,Chaenostoma hispidum,,"Chaenostoma hispidum is an attractive, bushy, dwarf shrublet, 100–500 mm high, with sprawling branches, up to 500 mm long. Stems and branches covered with rough, stiff hairs, up to the leaves. Leaves are decussately arranged (paired leaves arranged opposite and at 90° angles), oval to elliptical, toothed.

It bears axillary pairs of white, pink to mauve flowers, with the lower 2 stamens swollen, a superior ovary, a yellow gullet and narrow, funnel-shaped tube, 8–12 mm long, with 5 petals and 5 sepals. Flowering mainly from midwinter to midsummer, from July to January, but may have a few flowers at any time of the year.

Like many other herbaceous shrublets, C. hispidum grows relatively fast.","The name Chaenostoma means ‘gaping mouth’ and is derived from the Greek chaeno, meaning ‘gaping’ and stoma, ‘mouth’, referring to the funnel-shaped flower tube. The species name hispidum, means ‘covered with coarse bristles’ referring to the leaves that are covered with coarse and rigid hairs. They are called ‘skunkbush’ or stinkbossie, because the leaves have an unpleasant odour when crushed.","Chaenostoma hispidum has a narrow distribution, occurring in the Western Cape from the Cape Peninsula to Aasfontein, in the Agulhas National Park. This species grows on rocky sandstone or limestone outcrops, on flats and on shale slopes, in full sun to partial shade.

In the world, the family Scrophulariaceae consists of 269 genera and 5 100 species. In southern Africa there are 66 genera with 900 species (Koekemoer, Steyn & Bester 2013). The family has recently undergone a drastic reclassification, and many northern hemisphere genera with two-lipped flowers, previously considered to belong to this family, such as Digitalis, Antirrhinum and Penstemon, are now classified in a separate family, with the Plantago Manning (2009). The genus Chaenostoma occurs in Africa, but mostly in South Africa with 46 species and has recently been revived to accommodate all but 3 former Sutera species.",,"Chaenostoma hispidum is easily propagated and responds best when it is vegetatively propagated from tip and stem cuttings, preferably taken in summer (mid-October to mid-February). Use a root-stimulating hormone for soft cuttings; take cuttings from a healthy, disease free, vigorous mother stock, preferably at the coolest time of the day (morning or afternoon), to prevent water loss.

Use a well-drained and aerated rooting medium mixture of 1 part sifted fine bark, 2 part river sand or silica grit or 2 part perlite, and water well. Take cutting below the node with a sharp, sterilized cutting tool and place the cuttings on warm benches at temperature of 22–25ºC, in a moderately humid area or mist house. Rooting should take place after 4–5 weeks. Once cuttings have produced adequate roots, transplant into bigger containers and harden off under a shade cloth to prevent shock, before moving plants into full sun, or planting out in a full sun spot in the garden.

Once the root system has fully developed, prepare your soil; add compost to your garden bed and organic fertilizer to encourage new growth. Mix and aerate the soil to encourage root establishment. Choose a full sun to semi-shade area to plant in autumn to winter time (April, May or June) or during the rainy season, to prevent excessive use of water.",,,,,,,,
Protea mundii,Protea mundii,,"Protea mundii is a single-stemmed, upright shrub that reaches an average height of 3–8 m, but can occasionally reach 12 m, making it the tallest tree-like protea (Bean & Johns 2005). It reaches a width of 1.5–2 m. The trunk bears smooth, grey bark and reaches a diameter of 150–250 mm. Stems are downy but become hairless when mature (Rebelo 2001).

Leaves of P. mundii are elliptic to elliptic-lanceolate, a bright green with sparse hairs, becoming hairless when mature, although older leaves may have long hairs near the leaf base, whereas young leaves are velvety (Coates Palgrave 2002). Leaves are 60–120 mm long and 18–40 mm wide, tapering to the base, with an entire leaf margin distinctly veined with the midrib often reddish (Rebelo 2001; Bean et al. 2005) .

Humbly-sized flower cups are 60–80 mm long and made up of floral (involucral) bracts that range from pink to cream-green and are lightly covered with pale hairs. Flowerheads do not open widely, yet are clearly visible as they stand well above the leaves. Bract tips are fringed with white to tawny silky hairs, more so on the upper bract tips than the lower bracts. Flowers contained within the goblet of bracts rarely protrude from the mouth. The individual flower (perianth) is 50–70 mm long, the tube 12–15 mm long with wavy tips covered in silky hairs. The style is straight, 55–65 mm long and cream-coloured or pink. The pollen presenter is linear to thread-like, 8–10 mm long, having a large-knobbed tip (Rebelo 2001; Coates Palgrave 2002).

Flowering occurs in summer, from January to September, with a peak from February to April in the southern hemisphere. P. mundii is fast growing and easily reaches an age of 20 years (Brown, Duncan & Nurrish 2013). Fruit is a hairy nutlet which is retained on the plant (Coates Palgrave 2002). The predominant colour of P. mundii flowerheads is creamy white with a slightly greenish flush. Naturally occurring pink colour variants are much less common, though they are found in most populations (Rourke 1980). Protea mundii is a pioneer in the successional stages from tall fynbos to evergreen forest (Rourke 1980).

It is pollinated by Cape Sugarbirds and Sunbirds, and is visited by a number of other bird species as well. It is also popular with the bees that are often seen in the flowerheads at Kirstenbosch.

Protea mundii has adapted to survive periodic Cape fires by means of serotiny, and can be classified as a reseeder since plants are totally killed by fires. In this adaptation, seeds are withheld in the cone-like remains of the flowerheads on the plant until fire sweeps through in late summer. The old flowerheads open and the seeds are released and stimulated to germinate by the smoke. Open land provides an area with limited competition from other plants, and germination is assisted by the following autumn and winter rains.

","The name Protea was given by Linnaeus, allegedly after the mythological Mediterranean god Proteus who was able to take on many different forms; the allusion of the name being to the great variability of the genus. However, Linnaeus had only seen a few proteas by 1735, many only as drawings by Boerhaave. It seems unlikely that Linnaeus could have been aware of the variability in the genus by this stage and so a different derivation of Protea is possible. The greek proteia was a plural derived from protos, ‘before’ or ‘first’, and indicated ‘first prize’ or originally ‘chief rank’ or ‘first place’ (Jackson 1990).

Even though P. mundii was first collected near Knysna by William Burchell in March 1814, the species name mundii was given by J.F. Klotzsch (curator of the Berlin Herbarium) in honour of J.L. Leopold Mund, a Berlin pharmacist who was sent to the Cape in 1815 and collected plant specimens for the Prussian government, as a gesture of posthumous pardon towards their former employee who died in Cape Town in 1831 (Rourke 1980).

Interestingly, according to Rourke (1980) the plant was not described from Mund's specimens of P. mundii, but from a living plant flowering in the Cape House at the Berlin Botanic Garden in 1838. The plant had been grown from seed collected by Zeyher in South Africa and was given to the gardens by Mr Ecklon in 1835.","P. mundii has a rather disjointed distribution. Its main range stretches from the Outeniqua and Kouga Mountains near George, to the Strydomsberg Mountain range near Uitenhage, even extending up to the Winterhoek Mountains. It also occurs in a short coastal strip between Betty’s Bay and Hermanus in stands fringing forests from 200–1 300 m on permanently moist slopes. In the westerly population, it is locally common in ravines and sheltered, humid kloofs; whereas in the south Eastern Cape coast where rainfall is more evenly distributed, they occur in open country. Permanently moist habitats are a prerequisite for this species, bearing in mind that these are often well-draining areas receiving fresh mountain water.

It can survive in temperatures as low as -4°C. It is suitable for coastal gardens as well as temperate high rainfall areas.",,"This plant is very useful in a larger garden and is well-suited for screening or informal hedging. Although the flowers are not as attractive, large or showy as other Protea species, P. mundii is great for attracting birdlife such as Sunbirds and Sugarbirds into the garden. It can be planted amongst species of Coleonema, Felicia, Salvia and Leonotus to create an attractive Fynbos garden. This shrub or small tree grows well on a variety of soils, but is better suited to a well-drained soil that is slightly acidic, although it can tolerate slightly alkaline soils. In the garden it requires a position in full sun and regular watering until it has established. Branches should be shortened while the plant is still juvenile in order to maintain a compact and neater growth form (Eliovson 1967). When planting with companion plants, be sure to leave sufficient space around it for future growth; according to Eliovson (1967), P. mundii can reach a height of 1.8 m in a year if it receives sufficient watering! P. mundii can tolerate semi-arid conditions and is one of the easiest and fastest species of Protea to grow and will make a long-lasting addition to the garden. Flowering commences in the third year grown from seed.

Propagation of Protea mundii is successful by either cuttings or seed-sowing.

In the southern hemisphere, the best time to sow protea seeds is from late summer to autumn (March to May). Only plump, fertile seeds should be selected for sowing as most seeds within a seed head are infertile. In nature, many species of Protea have the adaptation of serotiny and P. mundii is a reseeder. Seeds therefore need smoke treatment to increase the germination rate. Seeds are sensitive to excess water and can rot; it is therefore essential that they be sown in a well-aerated, well-drained, sandy medium (Brown et al. 2013). Use a mixture of coarse river sand and finely milled bark as a sowing medium and cover seeds lightly with the medium. Place trays in a makeshift ‘tent’ which is pumped with smoke by means of a pipe connected to a fire drum. A smouldering burn can be created by burning a mixture of dry and green fynbos leaf and stem material. Seed trays should be left in the smoke for one to two hours. Water trays to rinse the smoke deposit into the medium and place under cover in a shade-house where they will be exposed to the fluctuating temperatures of warmer days and cooler nights. An optimum fluctuation is between 10°C and 20°C (Brown et al. 2013). Once the first true set of leaves emerge, prick seedlings out and plant into individual containers or pots into a soil mixture similar to that used for sowing. Water seedlings thoroughly and place under light shade for 7 days to harden off before placing in full sun. Transplant as required to prevent plants from being pot-bound and developing unhealthy roots (Brown et al. 2013).

Collect cutting material in the cool early morning and place in a wet plastic bag until propagation takes place. Take cutting material from healthy, disease-free plants during the summer months of November to late March when plants are not flowering and new firm growth has emerged. Ideally, cutting material is 200–250 mm long and is taken from upright growing, terminal or lateral shoots and not from side shoots. Remove the lower third of basal leaves, cutting below a node and above a node at the tip of the cutting. Dip the cutting in a liquid rooting hormone of sufficient concentration (Brown et al. 2013). Place cuttings in a sterilized multi-tray filled with a well-aerated medium consisting of equal parts finely milled bark and polystyrene beads. Trays are placed under standard mist-bed conditions with bottom heating of 22–25°C, and free air circulation is essential to prevent fungal growth and rotting of cuttings. Rooting takes place from 8–16 weeks. Transplant successfully rooted cuttings into larger pots, using coarse sand and finely milled pine bark, and harden-off under 50% shade cloth for 3–4 weeks before placing them in full sunlight. Plants can be fed with an organic slow-release fertiliser and a regular spraying programme be set in place to avoid any fungal attack (Brown et al. 2013).

Many species of Protea are susceptible to diseases and pests when cultivated in the artificial garden environment. Caterpillars, nematodes, scale insects, tipwilters and snout beetles are all possible pests of Protea mundii (Brown et al. 2013). There are a variety of fungi that can cause death of plants. Phytophthora cinnamomi causes root rot and is the most important root disease of proteas since it causes heavy losses during warmer summer months.",,,,,,,,
Bushman's Pipe,Ceropegia ampliata,,"Ceropegia ampliata is a perennial twiner or scrambler with a succulent stem arising from a fleshy, tuberous rootstock. Plants occasionally branch at the nodes and can grow up to 2 m and more in length. The stems are hairless and sometimes have longitudinal grooves. The plants have fleshy tuft roots from germinating seed or fibrous roots form at the nodes where the stem touches the soil surface. Leaves are borne on terminal growth; they are very small, up to about 3 mm long, and are lanceolate or heart-shaped. The leaves are shed early and the stem is the main organ used for photosynthesis.

Flowers are produced at each node, 2-4 together, opening one after the other. The corolla is tube-shaped, with segments at the end of the tube. These segments are joined at their tips to form a cage-like structure. The tube is straight or slightly curved, with an inflation at the base. The tube is pale green to white or white with green longitudinal stripes and with a narrow purple band around the mouth of the basal inflation on the inside. The corolla tube and segments are 50-70 mm long. Plants flower in summer, mainly between December and March.

Fruit bodies (follicles) are rarely produced and are usually green, sometimes speckled purplish. The follicles are usually in pairs, but very often only one of them develops and the other is aborted. Each follicle contains numerous seeds and as the fruit bursts open when it dries out, the seeds are dispersed by floating on the wind with their tufts of silky white hairs.

",,"Bushman's Pipe is commonly found on dry, stony hillsides, twining in other vegetation. The plant is found in the Limpopo Province, Mpumalanga, KwaZulu-Natal, the Eastern Cape and southern parts of the Western Cape, extending northwards as far as Tanzania. It also occurs in Madagascar.",,,,,,,,,,
Searsia glauca,Searsia glauca,resinous smell,"This is an evergreen, densely branched shrub 2–3 m tall, sometimes a small, multi-stemmed tree up to 4 m tall, with branches that are characteristically angular. Older branches, have rough pale grey bark that is slightly fissured, becoming gnarled with age. Stems and branches of this genus have prominent lenticels.

Compound leaves are borne on slender stalks, characteristically consist of three sessile leaflets (trifoliate), with the terminal one being the largest, are scattered or clustered on young reddish branchlets; tips of leaflets are often slightly indented. Leaf colour is glossy green when young, with a resinous coating that dries to leave a grey powdery layer on older leaves, giving them a distinctive bluish hue.

There are separate male and female plants, a phenomenon which is referred to as dioecious, with densely delicate pyramidal sprays (panicles) of flowers up to 50 mm long in late winter, through spring to early summer.The flowers are minuscule, greenish white or pale yellow, in the axils of the leaves (female) or at the end of the branches (male) clusters.The flowers are followed by small, spherical drupe berries (3 mm diameter), green ripening to reddish chestnut-brown in the late summer, and drying to black, through to autumn.","Most of the species grown in southern Africa belonging to the genus Rhus, have been placed in Searsia. Searsia was named after Paul B. Sears (1891–1990), who was head of the Yale School of Botany. The specific epithet, glauca, is from the Latin, meaning ‘bluish grey or green’ which refers to the distinctive colour of the leaves. Other noteworthy species are, Searsia chirindensis, S. lancea, S. leptodictya, S. nebulosa and S. pendulina.
","Searsia glauca is listed as LC (Least Concern) according to the Red List of South African Plants version 2015.1. Accessed on 2015/09/21at http://redlist.sanbi.org.

Searsia glauca is commonly found along the coastline of southern Africa. Although most common near the coast occurring on coastal dunes, bush and along watercourses, it is also found inland among fynbos vegetation.

S. glauca ranges from near Kentani in southern Transkei in the Eastern Cape, down the coast all along to the Cape Peninsula and up to Velddrif in the southwestern Cape. It also occurs further inland, reaching the Little Karoo near Worcester and Oudtshoorn, as well as the Baviaanskloof, near Steytlerville. Occurs along the mountain chain and adjacent highveld from the Soutpansberg in Limpopo, through the Mpumalanga to Swaziland and northern KwaZulu-Natal. Also occurs in Zimbabwe and Mozambique.
Anacardiaceae is widespread throughout the tropical, subtropical and warm temperate regions of the world, with about 200 species. Boasting economically important exotic species, such as the pistachio nut (Pistacia vera), cashew (Anacardium occidentale), and mango fruit (Mangifera indica).

Other exotic species within the family that are important, are Schinus molle (the pepper tree) and S. terebinthifolius (Brazilian pepper tree) from South America, because of their invasive nature. in South Africa. A few indigenous genera that belong to this family are Harpephyllum caffrum (wild plum) and the marula, Sclerocarya birrea subsp. caffra.

In southern Africa, there are about 91 taxa of Searsia, including the commonly cultivated karee (Searsia lancea) and witkaree (Searsia pendulina), and with about 80 trees and shrubs, it is the fourth largest tree family.

Searsia glauca plays an important role as a pioneer species in the ecologically cycle of plant succession, as it is able to establish itself under harsh environmental conditions, such as drought, salt spray and high wind.",,"Fast-growing, low maintenance shrub that does best in full sun. Very well adapted to harsh coastal conditions and so can tolerate poor soil and salty conditions, while still thrive as it is wind and drought resistant Suitable for water-wise gardening, and can also survive frost. Grow as a specimen shrub or in a group. Blue kunibush tends to grow straggly and needs light pruning to keep it shaped well; it can also be shaped to form a small tree and can be clipped into a hedge. If planted closely together, plants will form a solid barrier, making it suitable for use as a screen for unattractive views or to provide privacy, as windbreaks, and/or barriers against noise. Can be grown in a bird- and an insect-friendly garden. Both male and female plants are needed for the females to be pollinated, and therefore bear the berries. Searsia glauca can be propagated easily from seed or semi-hardwood cuttings.

The seeds usually have a shiny brown colouring when ripe. As soon as the seeds are dry, they can be collected. Sow the ripe seed in autumn in seedling trays, using a well-drained seedling medium. Only lightly cover the seeds and keep them moist, but never too damp. Seeds should start germinating from about four to six weeks after sowing. Transplant the seedlings into bigger containers when they reach the two-leaf stage. Sow fresh seed for best germination results. To improve germination soak the berries till the flesh of the fruit rubs off easily.

Cuttings can be taken in spring and early summer. Make semi-hardwood tip cuttings and use rooting hormone to improve rooting success. Cuttings should develop roots within three to five weeks if placed on bottom heat, after which they can be hardened off without heat and watered less often for two weeks, before being potted up. Because Searsia glauca is so hardy, it does not require any special attention once it has established its root system. Cuttings perform best if they are placed on a heating bench with an automated irrigation system and enough air movement in the greenhouse.",,,"The fruits of all the Searsia species are edible, if quite sour to the taste and traditional beer can be made from fermenting the fruit. Plants of Searsia glauca are good for conserving soil, preventing erosion, and are often used for stabilizing coastal dunes, as well as being a good garden subjects in harsh coastal environments. Female plants have bunches of currant-sized red or yellow berries, which are sometimes used in flower arrangements.",,,,,
Philenoptera violacea,Philenoptera violacea,,"Philenoptera violacea is a medium- to large-sized, deciduous to semi-deciduous tree up to 15 m tall with a wide-spreading, dense and rounded crown. The main stem is tall, straight and bare, occasionally bent and twisted. The bark is grey and flaking on older branches and stem, but smooth, light grey and covered with dense hairs on younger branches, exuding a sticky red sap when cut.

Leaves are large (70-200 mm long), unevenly compound with 1-3 pairs of opposite leaflets and one terminal leaflet, hard and rough in texture, shiny or glossy above and grey-green beneath, with prominent midribs. The terminal leaflets are always much bigger than the lower leaflets (about 180 mm long and 90 mm broad). Flowers are scattered, usually borne in dense terminal sprays 120-300 mm long at the tips of the branches, varying in colour from white and pink to bluish-pink, mauve or deep violet, and are sweet-scented. They appear from September to December, before or together with the new leaves. Fruit is a flat pod, non-splitting, relatively large (about 120 x 25 mm), hairless, tapering at both ends, persisting on the tree during winter, usually 2- or 3-seeded.

The seeds are kidney-shaped, reddish, and compressed.",The name Philenoptera is derived from the Greek words philenos (tractable or manageable) and pteros (wing) which conveys the meaning that the wing makes the pod manageable for dispersal. Violacea is derived from the Latin word violaceus (violet) which refers to the violet (blue-red) flowers of the apple-leaf tree.,"Philenoptera is a small genus of 12 species, found in Madagascar, and tropical and southern Africa. Seven of these species occur in southern tropical Africa and southern Africa. South Africa is home to three species of Philenoptera, which are found in four provinces of the country, namely Limpopo, Mpumalanga, KwaZulu-Natal and Eastern Cape.

Philenoptera violacea is distributed in three provinces of South Africa: Limpopo, Mpumalanga and KwaZulu-Natal. In Limpopo it is found in the northern part of the province. In Mpumalanga it occurs in the warmer, almost frost-free parts of the Lowveld and the northern bushveld regions, and in KwaZulu-Natal it is distributed in the northern part of the province. Philenoptera violacea is a frost-sensitive and drought-resistant species. The tree is frequently attacked by the spittle bug or frog-hopper, which causes exudation of water from stem and branches to such an extent that the ground or area covered by this plant is wet, allowing it to use the moisture in drought conditions. It occurs at low altitudes, from 50-1250 m, in drier areas, mostly on sandy or alluvial soils. Plants are usually found in bushveld, open wooded grassland, on the banks of seasonal streams, near water courses and on floodplains.",,"Propagation is by seed. The seeds must first be soaked in hot water, left overnight and planted the next morning in seedling trays. Cover the seeds lightly with river sand and keep moist. Placing a clear glass over the seedling tray can speed up germination.

Seeds usually germinate in four to six days after being sown. The plants should be kept in partial shade for three to five weeks before moving them into full sun, and should be planted in scattered clumps in a suitable habitat. The success rate of P. violacea is greater in frost-free areas. The plant is not frost-resistant, but it can survive in colder climates if properly protected during the first two to four years.",,,"Philenoptera violacea has economic value as the wood is used to make good, attractive household articles such as grinding blocks and tool handles. Generally the wood is commercialised in making carvings, grain mortars, building poles and mealie stampers. In African tradition, it is also used to make dug-out canoes. The leaves of the apple-leaf tree provide forage for giraffes, and the pods serve as a source of nourishment to these animals.

In southern Africa, P. violacea is used in traditional remedies. Most parts of the plant are used to treat diarrhoea. The roots are used for gastro-intestinal problems; powdered root-bark is used to treat colds and snakebite. Root infusions are commonly used as part of a hookworm remedy.",,,,,
Protea aristata,Protea aristata,,"Protea aristata falls within the group of ‘true’ sugarbushes which are characterised by their large, obconic flowerheads. P. aristata is an erect, stocky, single-stemmed shrub that reaches 2.5 m in height and a diameter of up to 3 m when growing in areas that evade fires, while the stem diameter reaches 250 mm (Rourke 1980).

Stems are erect, hairless and 5–7 mm in diameter. Trunk bark is smooth and grey, whereas younger stems have light brown bark. Narrow, linear and erect needle-like leaves are arranged in an upright position on the stems. Leaves are 70–110 mm long and 2–3 mm wide, are flattened with the petiolar region slightly tapering and are hairless, glaucous (greyish green or blue) and smooth, with a black point at the leaf tip. The beautiful, reddish pink flowerhead is obconic (inverted cone) to bell-shaped, is 110–140 mm long and 100–120 mm wide. Flowering is mainly during the hot and dry summer months in the southern hemisphere, and occurs from October to as late as February, with December being the peak flowering period (Rourke 1980).

Fruits ripen quickly and are shed about six to nine months after flowering. According to Rourke (1980), arid natural habitats promote early release of seed. This could possibly be due to flowerheads drying out a lot faster than flowerheads on plants under cultivation. Wild seed may be collected by wild-seed collectors as early as April, but seed will be fully ripe by May. If not collected by this time, seed could be lost once flowerheads begin to open and disperse their seed. However, plants under cultivation retain old closed flowerheads for up to a year and allow more time for seed collection.","The genus name Protea is derived from the Greek Proteus, a mythological god who had the ability to take on many different forms. This genus name was given by Carl Linnaeus in 1735 and alludes to the variation of form within the Protea family. However, it is unlikely that Linnaeus would have seen the great variability of the genus by 1735 and it could be possible that there is a different derivation of the name. The alternative derivation could be from the Greek Proteia, which is derived from protos meaning ‘before’ or ‘first’ and indicated ‘first prize’ or ‘first place’. This ‘first prize’ could allude to the sheer beauty and powerful impact of impressive protea flowers on botanists, explorers and collectors. The species name aristata is derived from Latin and means ‘awned’, referring to the prominent awns on the perianth limbs (Jackson 1990). It is a great wonder why Protea aristata, so readily accessible around the town of Ladismith and spectacular in beauty and form, was only formally documented by botanists in 1928, and that the general public has only been aware of this plant since the 1960s. In December 1928, T.P. Stokoe and R. Primos collected a specimen in bud from the Seweweekspoort near Ladismith and this date marked the botanists’ first acquaintance with P. aristata.","According to the website http://redlist.sanbi.org, checked on 21 December 2015, the conservation status of this plant is Vulnerable (VU) with a decreasing population trend. This status is largely due to too frequent fires which have caused a decline in the population numbers, especially since they are slow to mature. It is also an endemic species, being confined to the Swartberg region. The population of Protea aristata is estimated to have a maximum of 6 000 plants, with no subpopulation consisting of more than 1 000 individuals. Interestingly, Rourke (1980) commented that many people often thought P. aristata to be rare due to its scattered localities and that it being rare was most definitely not the case. A mere 30 years later, P. aristata is now classified as Vulnerable.

Protea aristata is endemic to the Klein Swartberg (a misleading name for the high, rugged mountains of the western Swartberg), between Bufffelspoort and Seweweekspoort in the Western Cape, and grows on ledges of inaccessible steep krantzes and rocky sandstone slopes at an altitude of 750–2 000 m.

The Proteacae family comprises of 14 genera and 352 species in South Africa.",,"Protea aristata is best propagated from seed. The best time to sow protea seeds is late summer to autumn (March to May in the southern hemisphere) and only plump, fresh seed should be selected for sowing. Many species of Protea have the adaptation of serotiny to survive periodic fynbos fires. Seeds therefore germinate much more successfully after being smoke-treated. Protea seeds are sensitive to excessive amounts of water and are susceptible to rotting, thus it is essential to sow them in a conventional seed tray in a well-aerated, well-drained medium consisting of coarse river sand mixed with finely milled bark (equal ratio). Seeds can be slightly covered with the medium, but make sure not to cover them too much as this will affect germination. If using the tent method of smoke treatment, allow trays to stand in the smoke for two hours and then water the trays to rinse the smoke deposit into the medium. Place treated trays under cover in a shade-house where they will receive optimal fluctuating temperatures of warmer days and cooler nights, between 10°C and 20°C. Prick seedlings out once the first true set of leaves emerge. Plant these into individual pots or containers into the same coarse medium. Water seedlings thoroughly and place under light shade for 7 days to harden off before placing in full sun. Transplant growing plants as required, preventing any unhealthy root formation (Brown et al. 2013).

When cultivated in the artificial garden environment, many species of Protea are susceptible to diseases and pests. Caterpillars, nematodes, scale insects, tipwilters and snout beetles are all possible pests of Protea aristata (Brown et al. 2013). A variety of fungi can cause death of plants. Phytophthora cinnamomi causes root rot and is the most threatening root disease of proteas since it causes heavy losses during warmer summer months.",,,,,,,,
Leucadendron rubrum,Leucadendron rubrum,,"Leucadendron rubrum is an erect shrub growing to 2.5 m tall. Plants develop from a single-stemmed base, with male plants being bushier and having smaller leaves than female plants.

Young branches in male plants are flexible, sometimes a purplish colour, and covered with fine hairs. As they mature they become smooth. Young female branches are much hairier than the male branches but are fewer in number and fairly stout.

Leaves are covered with silver-white hairs when soft and young. On maturing they lose most of the hairs and are a green-grey colour. The female leaves are twisted near the base, which, together with the shape of the female cone imitates the motion and shape of a spinning top.

Male and female flower heads are clustered along the ends of branches. Male flower heads are very small, measuring about 11 mm long but are a vibrant bright yellow, and flower in a golden plume. Female flower heads form a cone about 40 mm long. The yellow female stigmas pop out at the top of the cone in a tuft. The bracts forming the cone are a colourful mix of yellow, green, blue and red.

Flowering occurs in August and September and seeds ripen a few months later. Seeds are 8 mm long, wedge-shaped and hairy.

Plants grow relatively quickly and will flower after three years if grown from seed.","The genus name is composed of leucos meaning white and - dendron meaning tree. This refers to the iconic Silver-tree (Leucadendron argenteum) on which the genus was based. Early Dutch settlers originally referred to the Silver-tree as the Witteboom or 'White tree'.

It is unclear what the specific name rubrum (meaning red) refers to; possibly to the purplish bracts on the female flowerhead.

Leucadendron rubrum was first drawn and recorded in the early 1700s.","Leucadendron rubrum occurs across most of the Fynbos biome from the Bokkeveld escarpment in the north, Table Mountain in the southwest, to the Baviaanskloof Mountains in the east. Although it occurs across a large area, L. rubrum does not show much variation in habit. It grows on dry slopes on Cape Granite or Table Mountain Sandstone at an altitude of between 250 and 1500 m.

The Proteaceae family is large, consisting of about 1 400 species. The Leucadendron genus contains about 83 species; which, apart from 1 outlying species and 2 outlying subspecies, are all confined to the southern and southwestern Western Cape. Male Leucadendron plants produce lots of pollen that is blown by the wind onto the female flowers. Pollination occurs and seeds develop inside the cone on the female plant. Seeds are retained inside the cones for a number of years or until the plant is killed by fire. Each seed has a hairy parachute attached to it, so when the cone opens they float away carried by the wind away from the mother plant.",,"Leucadendron rubrum can be propagated from cuttings or seed. Both methods are prone to problems, as the hairs on the leaves of cuttings as well as the downy hairs on seeds tend to collect water, making the plants more susceptible to rotting. Treat material regularly with a fungicide and water sparingly.

Make cuttings from December to March (summer to autumn). The cuttings should be semi-hardwood, 60-100 mm long, and taken from the current season's growth. Dip the cuttings into a rooting hormone solution or hormone powder and plant into a medium of 50% polystyrene and 50% finely milled bark. Place in a growing house with bottom heat (25 ºC). Once the roots are well developed, remove from bottom heat and harden off for three weeks. Plant the cuttings into small bags and grow on until ready to plant into the garden.

Sow seed in April when the days are warm and the nights start to cool down (late summer to autumn). Dust the seed with a systemic fungicide. Sow on a well-drained medium consisting of 1 part loam, 1 part bark, and 2 parts sand, firm down and cover with a layer of sand or finely milled bark. Seed can be sown in an open seedbed, or in a seedtray placed in a sunny position. Germination begins after two to three weeks. Once two true leaves have grown, prick the seedlings out into small bags. Place the seedlings in a lightly shaded area with good air circulation. When plants are ± 50-100 mm tall, or after one year's growth, they can be planted into the garden. Nipping out the tips of the seedlings will encourage branching and produce a neater shrub.

The best time to place the young plants in the garden is just before the rainy season. This enables plants to establish themselves and send down deep roots before the hot, dry summer season. Leucadendron rubrum requires a hot, sunny, exposed situation with well-drained soil. Add a scoop of well-decomposed compost at planting and water well for the first year.

Once members of the protea family become diseased they are very difficult to treat, and it is better to prevent disease, rather than try to cure it. Make sure the environmental conditions are correct. This includes getting direct sunlight for most of the day, a well-drained soil which does not stay saturated and will not stagnate, and good air circulation ensuring that the above-ground parts of the plant dry quickly after watering. It is also important to ensure that the soil stays cool in the hot months and that roots are not disturbed by digging. A thick layer of mulch or groundcover planting can be used to keep the soil cool and prevent moisture loss. If any of these factors are not correct, the plants become weakened and stressed, and you can be sure to attract some form of pest or disease.

Leucadendron rubrum is very well suited to a hot dry fynbos garden. The grey-green foliage provides a muted backdrop or good filler planting between other brightly coloured flowering fynbos shrubs such as Leucospermum tottum, Erica baccans, Agathosma ovata and Euryops pectinatus.",,,,,,,,
Moraea polystachya,Moraea polystachya,,"The plants are perennial geophytes, the leaves and aerial stems dying back to the large dark-coated corm during the period of dormancy following flowering and seeding.

This species is very like M.venenata. The two species are not easy to distinguish: the leaves are 3-5 or 6 in number, long and strap-shaped, flat or slightly U-shaped and slightly twisted spirally; in Moraea polystachya they are about 6-12 mm wide with unthickened margins, whereas in M. venenata they are 10-30 mm wide, often with the lowest two close together to form a cup-like structure at the base of the stem and with the margins thickened and yellowish.

The flowering stem averages about 0.8 m tall in M. polystachya and 0.25 m tall in M. venenata, although well-grown plants can be much taller. The flowering stem is many-branched at the top, and although each flower lasts only one day, a succession of flowers is produced so that the flowering period may last for six to eight weeks.

The upright flowers are relatively unspecialized in the genus, with an outer ring of three large more-or-less spoon-shaped tepals, and an inner ring of three smaller and narrower tepals. In the outer or both rings, the tepals curve outward or downward from the point where they broaden. As mentioned above, flower colour ranges from dark blue through violet (with pinkish tones) to white with fine blue lines, to pure white. One or both tepal rings have yellow to orange nectar guides at the base of each tepal. M. polystachya has smaller flowers, with the outer tepals about 50 mm long, in contrast to those of M. venenata where the outer tepals may be up to 60 mm long. In the centre, is the self-coloured (same colour as tepals), complex expanded style structure, similar to that of the cultivated iris, which crowns the ovary and hides the stamens. In M. polystachya the ovary usually protrudes from the floral bracts and develops into a rounded capsule, 11-16 mm long; in M. venenata, the ovary is concealed by the floral bracts and develops into an oblong capsule, 16-20 mm long. The capsule splits open when mature to release many small angular, pale brown seeds.","Moraea polystachya was described (as Iris polystachya ) by Thunberg, the 'father of Cape botany', in 1782, from a collection he had made in the Eastern Cape 'in the area of the Sundays and Fish Rivers'. The species name polystachya, meaning many-branched, refers to the inflorescence, which differed greatly from the few-flowered species of the Western Cape already known to Thunberg. Its toxicity was mentioned by Ecklon, another famous botanical explorer, as early as 1830.","Moraea polystachya is widespread in central South Africa and Namibia, but its range overlaps that of M. venenata in Namibia and Northern Cape, South Africa. The average annual rainfall ranges from 100 to 700 mm, and is probably considerably less in a 'normal' year. In part of their common range, the sparse rainfall occurs in summer, while the remainder of the range receives rain in winter. The habitat is well-drained flats and slight slopes, with collectors often referring to the presence of calcrete deposits. Light frost occurs, but in mid-summer (when the plants are dormant) the temperatures may regularly exceed 40º C. Another closely-related, large blue-flowered species is Moraea speciosa, which occurs on the southern and western margins of the Karoo and could be confused with M. venenata when not in flower, on account of its several broad leaves with thickened margins. When in flower, it is not possible to confuse them: M. speciosa has pale blue, cup-shaped flowers with large nectar guides and which usually face to the side when open. The style structure is very different. Two distantly related species, M. amissa and M. gigandra, have already been discussed in this series.

As mentioned above, in the northern part of the common range, the plants flower mainly in autumn (March to May), but in the south, flowering is more usual in winter (June to August) or even spring (September, October). The complex style structure is known to be specifically adapted for bee pollination, but unfortunately no specific observations on these two species are available.","The dried plant material is also toxic ,the toxin has been identified as a cardiac glycoside (heart-poison).","Moraea polystachya is easy and rewarding to grow, but because it has a tendency to become weedy in cultivation, grow plants in pots or in a rockery where they can be controlled. For the best show, mass the plants together.

Plant the corms at a depth of two to three times their diameter in a well-drained soil mixture. Water lightly until after sprouting, when watering can be increased, but never over-water. Fertilize sparingly. Protect the corms from freezing during dormancy.

Sow seed in late summer or autumn. Seed germinates readily, and the same rules for watering and fertilizing apply. Seedlings flower in about three years.

Possible pests are red spider mite and aphids.",,,,"The dried plant material is also toxic and when accidentally incorporated in hay can have disastrous results. A few cases of fatal human poisoning have been reported, where the corms were mistaken for those of edible species, such as Moraea fugax. The toxin has been identified as a cardiac glycoside (heart-poison).",,,,
Erica triflora,Erica triflora,,"Erica triflora is a sturdy, erect shrub and may under favourable conditions grow to be a small tree up to 3 or even 4 m tall. It has a stout woody trunk and branches freely to form a rounded bush, which is covered with clusters of dark green to almost black leaves. The corolla is 5 mm long and bell- or urn-shaped, and flowers occur in clusters of three at the tips of the branches. The flowers vary, depending on locality, with those on Table Mountain being white whereas plants on the Hottentots Holland and adjacent mountains have smaller flowers, which may be tinged with pink.","The name is derived from the Latin word, 'triflor us' which means three-flowered, referring to the arrangement of the flowers in groups of three.","Erica triflora is limited to the northern section of the Cape Peninsula mainly on the upper slopes of Table Mountain and Devil's Peak. It also occurs on the Hottentots Holland Mountains, north to Porterville and across to the Kogelberg Mountains. It prefers to grow on the cooler, upper, south-facing slopes in well drained and seasonally moist sandy soils. Erica triflora occurs on the upper slopes of the mountains of the Western Cape where the climate is a bit cooler in summer. Some of these mountains are blanketed with summer south-easter cloud that provides extra moisture. It grows in nutrient-poor and sandy soils, often on steep slopes. This species flowers from July to November and is pollinated by bees.

",,"Erica triflora is an interesting addition to a fynbos garden or can be grown as a pot plant.

Erica triflora is very similar to the much sought after Erica baccans, but is not as easy to grow. Plants grow well enough in pots, but they are less hardy in the garden. Experience at Kirstenbosch has shown that the species is best planted in a cooler spot or where it is partially shaded. It is also advisable to plant it close together with other species of Erica or fynbos companion plants such as proteas, pincushions, buchus, brunias and restios.

Plant this Erica in a medium-sized container in a suitable, well-drained growing medium. A fynbos planting medium is made up of a combination of equal parts composted pine bark or pine needles and river sand. A little (20%) loam may also be added. It is a tall-growing species, so regular pruning is recommended to keep the plants well branched and compact. Plants that are pruned are more presentable, last longer and produce more flowers.

Erica plants are adapted to living in poor soils. Nevertheless, they should be regularly fed with low concentrations of diluted organic liquid or small amounts of organic pellet fertilizers.

It is propagated vegetatively by rooting fresh semi-hardwood tip or heel cuttings. Cuttings are rooted in multi-trays on heated benches under mist spray. Cuttings are rooted in autumn or spring in a rooting medium of equal parts bark and polystyrene chips. A semi-hardwood rooting hormone is used to aid the rooting process.

This species grows easily from seed when subjected to smoke treatment and sown in well-drained, acidic, sandy soil. Seed is normally sown from late summer into autumn, i.e. March to May.",,,,,,,,
Diosma haelkraalensis,Diosma haelkraalensis,characteristic odour,"Small, closely leafy, decumbent, aromatic shrub, up to 400 mm high. The leaves are oppositely arranged and recurving. There are a few white flowers in each inflorescence. Flowers have 5 petals and 5 stamens. The style is not conspicuous at the time of pollination. The stigma is capitate. In the middle of the flower is a fleshy, green to yellowish green, cup-shaped, nectariferous disc, with wavy margins.

The fruits have distinctive long horns.

Flowering is from autumn until spring, (April to September).","The name Diosma, means ‘divine odour’ and is derived from the Greek dios, meaning ‘divine’, and osme, ‘odour’, referring to the scent of the leaves when crushed. Haelkraalensis means ‘from Hagelkraal’ and refers to the wild locality of this species.","The Hagelkraal buchu is a range-restricted endemic species, found from Pearly Beach to Hagelkraal in the Western Cape. This species occupies crevices on limestone outcrops amongst Agulhas Limestone Fynbos, Agulhas Sand Fynbos and Overberg Dune Strandveld.The genus Diosma consists of 28 species, which are all small shrubs.

Diosma haelkraalensis forms part of a group of fynbos plants that grow on alkaline soils found on limestone outcrops along the coast, from Gansbaai to the Gouritz River. This specific group of plants is known as proteoid limestone fynbos, so named due to Protea species representing the majority of the species. It is restricted to the Bredasdorp geological formation Bredasdorp-Riversdale centre of endemism. This particular formation was integral in the evolution of various new fynbos species in this new habitat and soil conditions. Due to urbanization, agricultural expansion and alien invasive plants, limestone fynbos is now considered one of the most threatened vegetation types within the Cape Floristic Region.

Beetles and bees have been observed on plants during flowering and they could, therefore, both be potential pollinators.","Research indicates that the Hagelkraal buchu contains the same sulphur-containing compound (8-mercapto-p-methan-3-one) that gives the characteristic odour to commercial buchus, such as Agathosma betulina and A. crenulata. This species, therefore, offers economic potential in the spheres of medicine and cosmetics.","Sow the seed in autumn, using a medium that is light and has good drainage. A mixture consisting of equal parts of sand and compost or plain, coarse river sand can be used. Cover the seed with a thin layer of bark, sand or the medium and then water. Keep the seed tray in a covered area that provides enough good light and ventilation. Never allow the medium to dry out completely, or to be overwatered. The appearance of the first 4 true leaves, after 4–9 weeks, indicates the readiness of the seedlings for pricking out. Like all buchus, the fine roots must be handled with care.

The potted plants are now placed in a shady area for 3–4 weeks to harden them off, before placing in the sun. This will also be a good time to pinch out the growing tips of the seedlings, as this promotes a more bushy growth habit. Some nurseries also plant small buchu seedlings or plantlets grown from cuttings, in plugs after rooting. By using the plugs, the mortality rate is being decreased, plants grow quicker and plants get to be pruned between 2–3 times before being transplanted into larger bags. Regularly feed the young seedlings with some balanced nutrient products. Plants will be ready for transplanting into the garden after 8 to 9 months.

The taking of heel, tip or semi-hardwood cuttings is another way of propagation and will be the quickest way of achieving a flowering plant. Prepare cuttings of between 25–55 mm, remove about a third of the foliage and cut them below the node. Dip the cuttings in a rooting hormone and place in trays with a medium consisting of equal parts of bark and polystyrene. The cuttings are now placed in a mist-unit with heated benches. It takes 9–11 weeks for roots to develop. The rooted cuttings can then be moved to hardening-off for 2–3 weeks.

Pot the rooted cuttings in a well-drained soil mix and place in a shady area for 2–4 weeks to harden off. After this, they can be moved into full sun.

Diosma haelkraalensis will thrive in full sun, in well-drained and stony or rocky soil, where it is planted amongst other fynbos species. The ideal time for planting is between autumn and winter, which is the rainy season in the fynbos. This will enable plants to have a better chance of becoming established in the garden, before having to cope with the drought and extreme heat of summer.

Plant this buchu with: Acmadenia heterophylla and A. mundiana, Agathosma apiculata, A. collina, A. gonaquensis and A. serpyllacea, Coleonema album and C. pulchellum, Cotyledon orbiculata, Euchaetis meridionalis, Helichrysum dasyanthum, Restio dispar, Lampranthus aureus, Leucospermum patersonii, Lobelia valida, Pelargonium betulinum, Protea compacta and P. obtusifolia.

Planting at intervals of 20 to 30 cm, should provide enough space to encourage growth. This relatively dense planting is preferred by buchus, as it helps to retain soil moisture. Provide a good, thorough watering in winter. In summer, watering should just be moderate; however, do not allow plants to dry out completely. Regular mulching also aids in keeping the roots and soil cool in summer.",,,"No medicinal or cultural uses have been recorded, but this does not mean that this buchu was not used by the Khoisan people, who lived in this region in the past. Khoisan people used buchus to treat stomach complaints and mixed dried leaves with animal fat, to make a fragrant oil for rubbing on the body.",,,,,
Erica glandulosa subsp. fourcadei,Erica glandulosa subsp. fourcadei,,"This species forms a sturdy, medium-sized, multi-stemmed, bushy shrub growing up to 1,2 m tall. It grows close to the coast between boulders or tightly packed in amongst scrub vegetation. It produces attractive, semi-translucent, tubular flowers ranging from bright to dull red and even yellow and has conspicuous longitudinal veins on the corolla. There is a superb red-flowered form growing near Sedgefield. It has a distinctive hairy, green calyx and broad to elongate leaves. The hairy calyx and pedicel (stalk that attaches the flower to the stem) give it a mildly sticky feel. It flowers from May to November.","Erica glandulosa subsp. fourcadei was named in honour of Mr. H.M. Fourcade (1866-1948) by Louisa Bolus. He was a Frenchman who came to South Africa when he was 15 years old. He was a forester, businessman, land surveyor, inventor and an amateur botanist. He found this erica and brought it to the attention of Louisa Bolus at the Bolus Herbarium.","Erica glandulosa subsp. fourcadei is classified in the Red List as vulnerable. The habitat of the species is largely transformed due to coastal development, agriculture, forestry plantations and invasive alien plants. There are between eight and twelve severely fragmented subpopulations which continue to decline. The exclusion of fire is changing the coastal fynbos habitat of the species to dense thicket.

It is restricted to a narrow band along the coast from George to Cape St Francis.

Plants are often found scrambling over rocks and in the teeth of coastal winds and even within reach of salt spray and these conditions can reduce it to a mere 0.3 m in height. Plants are found growing in the following vegetation types: South Outeniqua Sandstone Fynbos, Tsitsikamma Sandstone Fynbos and Southern Cape Dune Fynbos. It is therefore likely that it is tolerant of soils ranging from acid to neutral or even slightly alkaline. It is able to withstand severe summer salt-laden winds and the dry environmental conditions associated with this.",,"It is an attractive horticultural species and flowers almost throughout the year. It is recommended as a strong-growing, reliable garden plant and is easy to maintain in average Mediterranean conditions and will also grow well as a large pot plant. This species is ideal for warm, sunny gardens and is salt-tolerant and therefore a good plant for a coastal garden.

Fourcade's erica is easily grown from fresh seed which should be sown in late summer or autumn. Germination is greatly enhanced by the application of smoke which mimics the conditions in nature. Seed is sown onto a well-drained, slightly acidic growing medium consisting of a combination of river sand and well decomposed pine bark in roughly equal proportions. Seed germinates in about six weeks, emerging as tiny, delicate plantlets that must be lightly watered with a watering can. Let the seedlings grow to about 10 mm tall before pricking them out into small individual pots. Young seedlings are encouraged to grow by feeding them every week with a diluted organic fertilizer. Seedlings grow slowly and will only be big enough after twelve months when they may be planted into the garden. It is advisable to plant out during the cooler autumn or early winter months to allow the plants to establish before the onset of summer.

It is also easily rooted from cuttings in autumn or spring, in multi-trays on heated benches under mist spray. Select small tip- or heel cuttings about 20-30 mm long, taking thin wood from the previous season's growth. Heel cuttings are preferred where a short side shoot is removed from the stem. The base of the cutting is treated with a rooting hormone for semi-hardwood cuttings which are then placed into a rooting medium of 50:50 fine-milled bark and polystyrene or perlite pellets.

It grows well near the sea in acidic to neutral soils. A good watering once a week during summer months is recommended for the first year, after which it will survive on its own.

It can be grown in a large container, providing that the correct, well-draining growing medium is provided. Fynbos planting medium is made up of a combination of equal parts composted pine bark or pine needles and river sand. A little (20%) loam may also be added. It is a woody species, so regular pruning is recommended to keep the plants well branched and compact. Plants that are pruned are more presentable, last longer and produce more flowers.

Erica plants are adapted to living in poor soils, but, for best results, should be regularly fed with diluted organic liquid or small amounts of organic pellet fertilizers that are low in phosphorus.",,,,,,,,
Caesalpinia bracteata,Caesalpinia bracteata,,"Ascending multi-stemmed 1–2(3) m tall. Branches are renewed from the base, at first green, turning reddish and eventually greyish black and somewhat longitudinally fissured later. Stems are armed with straight to downward curving, white prickles, up to 11 mm long.

Leaves are divided (bipinnate): leaflets 4–6 pairs per pinna, opposite to almost opposite, narrowly oblong to elliptic, 3–11 × 2–5 mm, rounded at the tips, with the tip ending in a point. Young leaves are reddish, soon becoming olive-green, smooth (without hairs) or slightly hairy on both surfaces or only along the midrib. Both sides of the leaves with densely dark gland-dots. The leaf stalk is 4–16 mm long.

The inflorescence is a simple raceme, up to 60 mm long, with conspicuous, purple-pink bracts, almost rounded, ending in a sharp point and soon deciduous. Flowers are purple-pink, the sepals 5, dark maroon, conspicuously veined on the inside, the lower sepal larger and forming a hood over the other sepals. Petals 5, free to the base, obovate, up to 12 mm long and 8 mm wide. Stamens 10, up to 10 mm long; filaments pink, white, up to 1.5 mm long. Ovary glabrous. Pods compressed, broadly oblong-ovoid, beaked, 15–22 × 10–15 mm, maroon-brown, hard and woody glabrous. Seed more or less, maroon-brown. (Based on Germishuizen 1991).

With sufficient rainfall, Caesalpinia bracteata will flower almost throughout the year. However, most plants in habitat flower from July to April.","Caesalpinia bracteata was first found by Andrew Gubb (1950–), the curator of the McGregor Museum, Kimberley (Northern Cape) on 8 July 1982 between the farms Yas and Warmbad, in the Northern Cape. It was found in the vicinity of the Orange River, South Africa’s largest river (Glen & Germishuizen 2010). Andrew collected herbarium specimens which he deposited at the McGregor Museum and a duplicate was sent to the National Herbarium in Pretoria. The next collections, 29 September 1987 and again in 1990, were those of Estelle van Hoepen (née Wasserfall), botanist from the then Botanical Research Institute. Gerrit Germishuizen, botanist from the former Botanical Research Institute, realising it was a new species, named it C. bracteata in 1991 in the botanical magazine Bothalia. The large floral bracts separating it from C. rostrata (Germishuizen 1991) from southern Namibia. Seeds were also collected by the author along the way during an excursion to Kaokoveld in June/July 2001. After consulting with one of the farm owners, Sakkie van Staden, the farm Skroef was visited on 23 July 2001, together with Tielman Haumann, where Caesalpinia bracteata was commonly encountered, and not far from the Orange River. On a subsequent expedition to Skimmelberg in southern Namibia in 2011, the farm Naros was visited, after consulting with the owner, to see if the plant also grew on the northern side of the Orange River in Namibia and, indeed, as we predicted, C. bracteata was encountered in crevices of Naros granitoid rock, representing the first record of C. bracteata for Namibia. The record further east at Pella, was collected by the ecologist Phillip Desmet.

Established by Linnaeus in 1753, Caesalpinia represents a large genus of more or less 200 species, most of which are confined to the New World (Heywood 1978). Caesalpinia honours the Italian botanist, Andreas Caesalpini (1519–1603) (Jackson 1990; Clark & Charters 2016). The species name bracteata, pertains to the large bracts protecting the flowers of C. bracteata. Many species are scrambing, bearing colourful flowers and many of which have been taken up in ornamental horticulture.","Caesalpinia bracteata is a rare species, known to occur over a small area and consists of fewer than 1 000 mature individuals. It is assessed in the Red List of South African plants as Vulnerable (VU). (Victor, Desmet & Van Wyk 2005).

Caesalpinia bracteata is a rare shrub confined to the Naros granitoid geological formation (Miller 1980; Visser 1984; Van Wyk & Smith 2001). It is only known from between Pella in the east and Onseepkans in the west, along the Orange River of the Northern Cape and also from Namibia on the opposite side of the river, on the farm Naros. The vegetation consists of semi-desert and the vegetation named as Lower Gariep Broken Veld (Bushmanland Bioregion of the Nama-Karoo Biome) (Mucina & Rutherford 2006).

Plants share their habitat with species such as wild abutilon (Abutilon pycnodon), camel thorn (Vachellia erioloba), black thorn (Senegalia mellifera), butterflyleaf (Adenolobus garipensis), shepherd’s tree (Boscia albitrunca), smelly shepherd's tree (Boscia foetida), leafless wormbush (Cadaba aphylla), karee corkwood (Commiphora gracilifrondosa), Namaqua jackalberry (Diospyros acocksii), Namaqua fig (Ficus cordata), bell spikethorn (Gymnosporia tenuispina), river spiderbush (Maerua gilgii), Chinese lanterns (Nymania capensis), green-hair thorn (Parkinsonia africana), desert broom (Sisyndite spartea), and the buffalo thorn (Ziziphus mucronata). Rainfall is mainly in summer and consists of thunder showers and is below 100 mm per annum. Temperatures are high especially during the summer months, when it is often above 40ºC. Winters are warm and frost a rarity. Southern Africa has 10 species of Caesalpinia of which 4 have been introduced and are invasive (Germishuizen 2001). The other 6 are indigenous to southern Africa (C. bonduc, C. bracteata, C. merxmuellerana, C. pearsonii, C. rostrata and C. rubra). The last four are confined to dry regions of Namibia. The Mauritius thorn (Caesalpinia decapetala), bird-of-paradise (C. gilliesii), C. pulcherrina and C. spinosa are invasive (Henderson 2001). Probably the best known is the bird-of-paradise (C. gilliesii), which is common in the Northern Cape.

Little is known about the pollination of Caesalpinia bracteata. The pollinators are insects and very possibly it is bees, especially the honey-bee. The seed has a very hard coat and adapted to germinating in crevices of the Naros granitoid rocks. Plants grow scattered on rocky outcrops, often in crevices or Naros granitoid rocks, always in full sun, and are locally common. The stems are erect and the prickles on the stem protects the plant from herbivores. With disturbances such as fire, the shrub will simply resprout.",,"Caesalpinia bracteata shows horticultural promise for semi-arid to arid gardens and is best suited for Karoo and Desert gardens (Van Jaarsveld 2010). Sow in a sandy soil mixture in spring or summer. Germination should be within 3 weeks. Transfer to individual containers when big enough to handle. Best to treat the seed with a fungicide or fungal inoculant before sowing. Young plants have been established in the Botanical Society Conservatory at Kirstenbosch National Botanical Garden in 2002, from seeds collected by the author on the farm Skroef in the Northern Cape, where the plants can be seen. It flowered for the first time 6 years after sowing. Plants given to Kevin Koen, horticulturist from Calitzdorp Klein Karoo, planted them in his succulent Karoo garden with great success, flowering annually.",,,,,,,,
Lachenalia fistulosa,Lachenalia fistulosa,sweetly scented ,"The Cape hyacinth consists of a single white fleshy bulb, about 20-25mm in diameter, covered by a multi-layered brown papery tunic, with fine white adventitious roots, and one or two strap-like lanceolate leaves 45-120mm long. Lachenalia fistulosa does not have any bumps or pustules on the upper surface of the leaf as do some Lachenalia species. The leaves are leathery and usually bright green, occasionally covered with dark green, brown or magenta spots on their upper surface. The leaves will start to emerge a few weeks after the first rains in autumn, and then wither naturally in late spring/early summer .

The inflorescence, in the form of a spike, can grow up to 120mm tall and appears in late spring (September to November in the southern hemisphere). Flowers are tubular, swollen at the base and somewhat constricted and then flaring distinctively at the mouth. The flower colour is variable. Plants on Lion's Head and Signal Hill tend to be pale cream or grey, while just a few kilometres away on the slopes below Devil's Peak they are light blue with lilac or pink tips. Other colour forms include yellow, white and violet. All flowers age to a dull red. The flowers are sessile (without a stalk).

The fruit are small capsules that ripen a month or two after flowering to release small shiny black seeds which are shaken loose by wind action. Like all other Lachenalia species, L. fistulosa is a typical winter-growing bulb that is summer-deciduous, i.e. it becomes completely dormant during the hot, dry summer months in the Mediterranean-type climate of the Western Cape.

Lachenalia fistulosa has sweetly scented flowers and is pollinated by Cape honeybees ( Apis mellifera subsp. capensis ). Populations tend to flourish and flower profusely in the season after a veld fire as the removal of other vegetation results in them having optimal sunlight. As the height of surrounding vegetation increases, they tend to flower less and can sometimes remain completely dormant. This pioneering nature is evident in vast populations that flourish and flower in the frequently mowed roadsides along De Waal Drive, Cape Town.",Its specific name fistulosa refers to the hollow formed by the tepals of the flower.,"Lachenalia fistulosa is restricted to the Cape Peninsula, except for a disjunct late-flowering population at Miaspoort in the Du Toitskloof Mountains. It occurs in Hawequas Sandstone Fynbos, Granite Fynbos and Peninsula Shale Renosterveld vegetation types, preferring heavy stony shale or granite soils, sometimes occurring singly, but often in large stands.",,"Lachenalia fistulosa is very easy to grow and a rewarding species to grow as a pot subject. The soil medium should be fairly well-drained and consist of about half coarse washed sand and half finely sieved compost. Use this mixture to fill the lower two-thirds of the pot. The upper third should be pure sand (with no loam or compost) into which the bulbs are planted. This layer stays relatively dry, preventing the bulbs from rotting if they should get too wet, while the roots can safely penetrate the richer moister organic medium below. Place the pots in full sun where the plants will grow very happily outside during the winter months, providing the temperature does not drop below freezing. In summer, the bulbs should be kept dry, preferably in a cool position. One can either lift the bulbs and store them in paper bags or store them in their pots. They perform well if they are repotted every 2-3 years with fresh soil medium.

They are easily propagated by leaf cuttings, which can be removed from the plant by slicing them at the base of the leaf blade. Half bury these leaves in a very coarse, free-draining sandy medium and leave them in a cool place out of direct sunlight. Keep the soil relatively dry to prevent the leaves from rotting, while keeping the humidity quite high — humid air and dry soil is the trick. Within a few months, small bulbils will appear along the cut edge at the base of the leaf. Eventually the leaf will wither but the bulbils can be planted like normal bulbs the following season. Flowering will take 1-2 years.

They are also easily raised from seed, which should be sown in autumn in a similar medium used for cultivation with a thin layer of sand placed over the seed. Water them gently but regularly in the first few weeks. The seedlings should germinate within about 2-3 weeks. Flowering will take 2-3 years.

Lachenalia fistulosa doesn't have many pests apart from snails and caterpillars (which can be removed by hand) and mealy bug which should be treated with a systemic pesticide. A rust fungus can be problematic and appears as orange blotches on the leaves, often developing where a leaf has been damaged by hail, for example. This is easily preventable (which is preferable) and treatable with common fungicides.

Not much fertilising is required for these bulbs, as they are not generally very demanding, but they would respond well to small doses of a diluted low-nitrogen liquid fertiliser.",,,,,,,,
Kalk boegoe,Agathosma thymifolia,mildy aromatic,"This is a mildly aromatic shrub that grows to just over a metre, with smooth and rounded stems. Plants are single-stemmed and branch near ground level. Leaves are alternate and rounded. Pink to mauve flowers appear in lax terminal clusters at the tips of branches. Flowering time is from July to September. Fruits are 3(-4) chambered.","The genus name Agathosma is derived from the Greek words agathos which means good, and osme which refers to the distinctive and characteristic fragrance of the genus. The oil glands on the leaves and fruit normally release an aromatic fragrance when crushed. There are 150 species of Agathosma. The majority of them are confined to the Western Cape.

The specific epithet thymifolia refers to the leaves that are like those of thyme. Thyme comes from the genus Thymus, and folium means leaves in Latin. The common name kalk boegoe refers to the Afrikaans word for lime and indicates that this species grows on limestone soils.","Agathosma thymifolia is threatened and has a Red List status of Vulnerable (VU).

This buchu is found on coastal sand and dunes on limestone in the Western Cape from Vredenburg to Yzerfontein. This explains its common name, kalk boegoe — kalk is the Afrikaans word for lime.",,"Sow seeds in autumn. The medium should be light and have good drainage. Mixtures of equal parts of sand and compost, or just plain coarse river sand, will do. Cover the seeds with a thin layer of bark or sand and then water. Place the seed trays in a covered area that provides sufficient good light and ventilation. The medium must never be allowed to either dry out completely or be overwatered. Germination can take from 4-9 weeks. The appearance of the first four true leaves normally indicates the readiness of the seedlings for pricking out. Handle the fine roots with care.

The potted plants can then be placed in a shady area for 3-4 weeks to harden off before placing them in full sun. This will also be a good time to pinch out the growing tips of the seedlings to promotes a more bushy growth habit. Feed the young seedlings regularly with some balanced nutrient products. Plants will be ready for transplanting into the garden after 8 to 9 months.

This buchu can also be propagated vegetatively by taking heel, tip or semi-hardwood cuttings during late autumn / early winter, or late spring / early summer. Take fresh material from the current year's growth. Prepare cuttings of 25-55 mm, remove about a third of the foliage and cut them below the node. Dip the cuttings in a rooting hormone and place them in trays with medium consisting of equal parts of bark and polystyrene. Place the trays in a mist unit with heated benches. It takes 9-11 weeks for roots to develop. Pot the rooted cuttings in a well-drained mix and place in a shady area for 2-4 weeks to harden off. After this, they can be moved into full sun. After the next 7-8 months plants can be planted into the garden.

Agathosma thymifolia will thrive in full sun and well-drained soil where it is planted amongst other fynbos species. The ideal time for planting is in the rainy season between autumn and winter. Plants should then have a better chance of establishing in the garden before they have to cope with less water or the heat during summer.

Plant the kalk boegoe with: Coleonema album , Metalasia muricata , Delosperma litorale , Helichrysum dasyanthum , Lampranthus aureus , L. amabilis , L. amoenus , Protea obtusifolia , P. compacta , P. scolymocephala , Salvia africana-lutea , Pelargonium betulinum , Lobelia valida , Chrysocoma coma-aurea , Crassula dejecta , Senecio elegans , Agathosma imbricata , A. serpyllacea , Searsia crenata , Chrysanthemoides monilifera and Cotyledon orbiculata.

Space plants about 200-300 mm apart. This should provide ample space to encourage growth. This relatively dense planting is preferred by buchus as it helps to retain soil moisture. Provide a good thorough watering during winter. Moderate watering is required in summer.",,,,,,,,
Ekebergia pterophylla,Ekebergia pterophylla,,"Sturdy shrub or small, evergreen tree with a flat crown and tidy habit, slow growing, from 2 to 5 m tall. The main stem is usually attractively gnarled, although in a sheltered position it will grow straighter, with light to dark grey bark that may often appear mottled.

The alternate, compound, blue-green leaves have one or two pairs of leaflets with a rounded terminal leaflet, but the most distinguishing characteristic is the broadly winged rachis and petiole.

The newly emerging leaves are tinged with pink and add to the attractiveness of the plant.

The small, sweetly scented flowers are borne in compact clusters from July to November. They are mainly white in colour but are also often tinged pink. The plants are dioecious, meaning unisexual, so male and female flowers occur separately on different plants. Small, fleshy, round, berry-like fruits are borne from February to May. They start out pale yellow and ripen through red to black — another feature that makes this plant attractive.

The rock ash can be confused with the tree jasmine, Schrebera alata. However, the leaves of the tree jasmine are arranged opposite not alternate like the rock ash; the tree jasmine's leaves are also hairy, whereas the rock ash has leathery leaves.","The genus Ekebergia was named after Captain C.G. Ekeberg, whose sponsorship, in the 18th Century, made it possible for Anders Sparrman, the author of this tree species, to visit Africa. The specific name pterophylla means winged leaf. Although it is commonly called the rock ash, this tree is not related to the true ash species in the family Oleaceae.

","Ekebergia pterophylla naturally occurs in montane and coastal forests, usually amongst rocks on outcrops or in ravines and on forest margins, from the Western Cape through to Mpumalanga and Limpopo, but mainly in KwaZulu-Natal and Pondoland as well as in Swaziland. It does well in gardens throughout South Africa, adjusting well to local climate, temperature and rainfall. E. pterophylla belongs to the mahogany family (Meliaceae). This is a large tropical and subtropical family of trees and shrubs. Some well-known members include red mahogany (Khaya anthotheca), African mahogany (Khaya senegalensis) and mahogany (Swietenia mahogani) This is a well-represented family with 51 genera and 800 species world-wide, many of which contain certain bitter tasting chemical compounds, some of which have insecticidal properties. It is also a very important tropical timber family. Ekebergia capensis is another species found in cultivation.

The rock ash's scented flowers attract bees and its fruits are enjoyed by birds. The plants are dioecious: the male and female flowers are on separate plants.",,"The plant is suitable as a slow-growing, specimen shrub in any garden but particularly suited to small gardens, as it does not get very big and it has such a neat habit. The clusters of scented flowers and yellow to red berries are what make this tree so ornamentally decorative and enjoyable, because between the long seasons of flowering and fruiting this shrub has something to offer almost all year long. It also makes a fantastic container plant, and would also be well placed amongst boulders, or in a rockery in a hot, sunny, exposed spot (as this is closest to its natural habitat), although it will tolerate light shade and a more protected aspect. If planted in an exposed situation in a windy coastal garden, it will most likely exhibit a wonderfully gnarled trunk. It is wind-tolerant, water-wise and will tolerate drought but as with most plants, will do well with consistent, if infrequent, watering, regular composting, and an occasional feed with a high nitrogen, organic or chemical fertilizer to boost its growth.

The rock ash is easily grown from seed sown in spring. Soak the berries in water for a day and then remove the flesh to expose the seeds. Sow seed in trays filled with potting soil, river sand or a mixture of compost and river sand (1:1). Plant no deeper than 5 mm. The seed should germinate within 4 to 8 weeks. Seedlings should only be transplanted after reaching the two-leaf stage.

The rock ash can also be grown from tip or hardwood cuttings taken in spring. These cuttings can be treated with a rooting hormone to help stimulate rooting. Pot into a well-drained potting mix once the cuttings have rooted and have hardened off.",,,,,,,,
Nerine gibsonii,Nerine gibsonii,,"Nerine gibsonii is an evergreen or summer-growing geophyte reaching 150-300 mm in height. Its several, pale green thread-like leaves are erect or suberect, distinctly channelled along the upper surface, and grow up to 20 mm long and 2 mm wide. The globose bulb produces an entirely subterranean neck up to 35 mm long.

The flowers are strongly zygomorphic with relatively long, broad perianth segments up to 35 mm long and 7 mm wide. The perianth segments range in colour from pure white through several shades of pale pink, rarely to purple. Four to nine flowers are produced per flower stem that reaches up to 300 mm high. Both the flower stem and flower stalks are minutely pubescent, and the perianth segments each have a conspicuous dark pink central keel in the lower half, shading to white or bright green in the upper half. The perianth segment margins are slightly wavy and, unlike most other nerines, the tips are not recurved. The stamens have distinct, tooth-like appendages at their bases, white or pale pink filaments that are bent downwards, and prominent, deep maroon unripe anthers.

The fruit is a papery capsule containing one to several ellipsoid, pale green, fleshy seeds. Like all other members of this genus, the seeds of this species do not undergo a dormant period but germinate almost immediately after they have matured. The water-rich seeds are able to do this by drawing on nutrients stored in the plentiful storage tissue of the seed.","The generic name Nerine was established in 1820 by the cleric and amaryllid expert, Rev. William Herbert, Earl of Carnarvon. It is unclear whether he named it for Nerine, the Greek mythological sea nymph and daughter of sea god Nereis and Doris, or for Nereide, the daughter of Nereus, son of Oceanus. The specific epithet gibsonii commemorates Mr L.F. Gibson of Engcobo in the former Transkei, who first collected this species in the mid-1950s.","Endangered

Nerine gibsonii has a highly restricted distribution in the western parts of the former Transkei in the Eastern Cape. Its habitat has been much reduced by overgrazing and road construction, and it is currently confined to just a few rather vulnerable sites. It usually occurs along streambanks in wet, heavy, black, acid soil. In the wild the bulbs are dormant over the cold winter period but under cultivation they usually remain evergreen. The flowers of Nerine gibsonii are self fertile and do not require pollinators in order to form seeds. The enlarging, ripening seeds force the papery fruit capsule to split open, thus releasing the seeds that fall to the ground and germinate close to the mother plants, eventually forming large colonies.",,"Nerine gibsonii is most suitably grown as a container subject in a sunny position. Its active growing season extends from early summer to mid-autumn, during which time it requires heavy watering about once per week, but in winter it can either be dried off completely, or watered far less often, about once per month. It tends to remain evergreen in temperate climates and it likes an acid, well-drained, sandy growing medium such as equal parts of coarse river sand and finely sifted, acid compost. In the southern hemisphere, 20-25 cm diameter plastic pots suit it well, but in cold climates of the northern hemisphere, terracotta containers are preferable, to ensure adequate aeration of the growing medium. The bulbs are planted with the top of the neck resting at or just below soil level. Once planted, they like to remain undisturbed for at least five years, only needing lifting and dividing when flowering performance diminishes markedly. The bulbs do not multiply as rapidly as many other Nerine species do, and they do not require supplementary feeding at all, as feeding has the effect of producing foliage at the expense of flowers.

This species is best propagated by seeds sown as soon as they are easily removed from the seed capsules. Sow the seeds evenly in deep seed trays or pots, in the same acid growing medium suggested for adult bulbs, and cover with a 1 cm layer of soil medium. Water well with a fine rose and place in a sunny position, under cover from heavy rain. Allow the seedlings to grow through their first winter, and lift them at the beginning of their third spring season and plant into permanent containers. Flowers can be expected for the first time during the third or fourth seasons, under ideal conditions.

The leaves, flowers, stems and bulbs of N. gibsonii are highly susceptible to attack by lily borer (amaryllis caterpillar), and the bulbs are often subject to the universal mealy bug scourge.",,,,,,,,
Brunia noduliflora,Brunia noduliflora,,"Brunia noduliflora is an evergreen rounded shrub that grows 0.6-1.5 m tall, coppicing from a fire-resistant, woody base. The branches are covered with minute hairs and are closely covered with many small, 2-3 mm long, needle-like leaves lying flat against the branch. The flowers are in dense globose heads 10 mm across, like fluffy pom-poms, white and fragrant, loosely or heavily clustered in corymbs (± flat-topped inflorescences in which the branches arise at different points). They are made fluffy by their long stamens, and age to an attractive brown-pink. Flowering time is mainly autumn to winter (March to June), the flowers opening soon after the first rains.

After flowering and fertilisation, the flowers fall off leaving the large, knobby, greyish-brown fruiting heads that stay on the bush for several years. New buds appear soon after the flowers, but these do not open until the following winter and are thus carried on the bush throughout the summer.","The genus Brunia is most likely named after a contemporary of Linnaeus, the apothecary, Dr Cornelis Brun, who travelled in Russia and the Levant, although it could also be in commemoration of Dr Alexander Brown, a ship's surgeon and a collector who worked in the East Indies around 1690. The species name noduliflora means bearing flowers in nodules, from the Latin nodulus meaning small knot and flos meaning flower.

Brunia nodiflora is a synonym for both this species and the completely unrelated species Widdringtonia nodiflora. This is because when Linnaeus named the genus Brunia in 1753 he based his original description of B. nodiflora on a specimen that was subsequently discovered to be a sterile twig of Widdringtonia nodiflora.

This caused a nomenclature nightmare when it was discovered by Elizabeth Powrie in the 1970s. It meant that Brunia nodiflora was without a validly published type specimen or description; and that Brunia nodiflora L., the original description by Linnaeus, was the earliest name and specimen for the species then known as Widdringtonia cupressoides. Powrie tidied up the mess. She proposed the name W. cupressoides (L.) Engl. be changed to W. nodiflora (L.) Powrie, with Brunia nodiflora L. as the base name and synonym.

Linnaeus' mistaken specimen is recognised as the type specimen, and the original description by Linnaeus applies to this widdringtonia. Since Linnaeus' description of the genus Brunia in 1753, various other botanists had worked on the Brunia family, described new species and genera, and had reorganised the species and genera. To prevent serious upheaval in the nomenclature of the Bruniaceae, Powrie proposed that the more recently described genus Berzelia Brongn. be conserved over the older Brunia L. And to prevent the disappearance of the genus Brunia, she proposed that it be conserved and the nomenclature of the family preserved by returning to the more broad definition of the genus as described by Lamarck in 1785. Brunia nodiflora sensu auct., non L. is a synonym for B. noduliflora, i.e. descriptions of the species by all authors other than Linnaeus apply to this species.","Brunia noduliflora is endemic to the south-western and southern Cape. It is common on hills and mountains slopes from the Olifants River Mountains to Piketberg, the Cape Peninsula, Jonkershoek, Hottentos Holland, Kogelberg through to Hermanus, and on to the Van Stadens Mountains and Uitenhage. It grows in full sun, on rocky sandstone slopes, often in moist areas, next to rivers or running water. The Brunia family consists of 12 genera and 77 species, endemic to South Africa and concentrated in the south-western Cape. The 12 genera include Audouinia (1 species), Berzelia (12 species), Brunia (7 species), Linconia (3 species), Lonchostoma (5 species), Mniothamnea (2 species), Nebelia (6 species), Pseudobaeckea (4 species), Raspalia (16 species), Staavia (9 species), Thamnea (7 species) and Tittmannia (5 species).",,"Brunia noduliflora is a slow-growing shrub, best suited to fynbos gardens in acidic, sandstone soils. It requires a sunny position, acidic, well-drained soil and moderate water. It is wind-resistant and is most likely tender to frost but should survive short cold snaps to 0 or -1° C. Do not feed with strong fertiliser and manure; rather apply a thick layer of well-rotted compost in spring and autumn, and, if necessary, feed with low-dose organic fertiliser or slow-release fertiliser. It is suitable for a seepage area provided it is growing in well-drained soil on a slope.

B. noduliflora can be propagated vegetatively by cuttings taken in autumn or spring from new growth on healthy plants. Use semi-mature side shoots. Heel cuttings and tip cuttings can be taken if the side shoot is long. Remove the lower leaves and dip in rooting hormone for hardwood cuttings. Cuttings should not be longer than 50 mm. They should start rooting after about 4-5 weeks. Hardening off should take about 3 weeks. Pot the plant in acidic, well-drained soil.

Sow seed in autumn. Treat the seeds with Kirstenbosch Instant Smoke Plus Seed Primer to enhance germination. Harvest the seeds from the previous year's fruiting heads. Use a well-drained, acidic medium, cover the seeds lightly, water gently and keep moist but not wet. Germination should take about four to six weeks. Place the seedlings in good light but not in direct sun.

Trevor Adams is thanked for helping with information on the cultivation and propagation of Brunia noduliflora.","Brunia noduliflora has no English common names but quite a few Afrikaans ones: fonteinbos meaning bush at the fountain or spring because these plants are often found growing next to running water; knoppiesbos or knoppies, meaning knobby bush, from the resemblance of the flower heads to little knobs; stompies, meaning little stumps, referring to the fact that after a fire all that's left of the burnt plants are stumps; volstruisies, meaning little ostriches, a name used by children referring to the flower heads on certain bushes affected by galls that suggest a number of little ostriches clustered together.",,,,,,,
Crossyne guttata,Crossyne guttata,,"Crossyne guttata has glaucous or deep green leaves that are absent at the time of flowering and lie flat on the ground, usually in pairs or fours. The leaves are somewhat narrow, smooth and leathery, but with coarsely bristly, brownish maroon margins and maroon spots underneath. The hairs are quite noticeable even on seedlings, and are brown.

The plant reaches up to 450 mm tall when in flower. The flowers are as many as 200, presented in large, rounded heads, on rigid, radiating pedicels.

The flowers are small, dusky pink to purple-maroon, with the petals curling back and soon turning brown. The density and colour of the flowers, create a striking impression and can be seen from afar and usually appear in late summer to autumn, from February to April. The plants flower best in the first few years after a fire, but they are not totally dependent on fire to flower. Like most members of the Amaryllidaceae, the seeds have a characteristic black or blue crust of the pigment phytomelanin, and are contained in berries or spherical capsules.

","Crossyne is the new name for two species of bulbs belonging in the Amaryllidaceae family. These plants were previously thought to be of the genus Boophone. The difference between the two, is that the bulbs in the genus Crossyne are underground, whereas, with Boophone, the bulbs are usually somewhat exposed. They also differ from the genus Boophone, in capsules and seeds. Crossyne species have many small flowers in each inflorescence. There are two species of Crossyne, this one and C. flava, the yellow parasol lily. There are two species of Boophone, B. disticha and B. haemanthoides.

Guttatus is a Latin word meaning ‘spotted’ or ‘speckled’, referring to the spots on the leaves.","According to the website http://redlist.sanbi.org, checked on 6 July 2016, the conservation status of this plant is Least Concern (LC).

Crossyne guttata is a widespread species, found on shale and granite flats and lower slopes in Renosterveld, in the western and southern Cape of South Africa. Crossyne guttata is pollinated by small butterflies, wasps, honeybees and short proboscid flies. The flowers age sequentially, so the attractiveness of the umbel is prolonged. The seed capsules are perfectly spherical and are dehiscent (break loose and tumble in the wind). The seed coat is covered with stomata, whereas, with species of Boophone, the seed coat is corky, another distinguishing factor between the two.",,"Crossyne guttata ismost suited to grow in pots or in dedicated rock garden pockets, that are kept absolutely dry in summer. Like most bulbs, mass planting is always a good option for a nice display. They require full sun or very bright light for as much of the day as possible. The bulbs are planted with the top of the neck at, or just below the soil level, needing sporadic drenching, approximately once every 2 weeks, in winter.

When growing it in congtainers, plant in large pots, preferably one in each pot, as the bulb has a large inflorescence. This will also give the grower full control of the plant as it needs to be kept completely dry in summer. Also take note to place the bulbs in sunny positions as they prefer full sun.

Sow seed in autumn, in deep containers as soon as the seed is ripe. The seedlings normally reach maturity in a minimum of 7 to 8 years under ideal conditions, thereafter will flower intermittently. An ideal soil mix for this bulb is river sand and bark, in a ratio of 2:1.

In cultivation the plants are irregular in flowering. Some forms of C. guttata flower consistently every year in cultivation, whereas, others hardly ever flower. In the wild, the species blooms in abundance within weeks of wildfires.

These plants are normally attacked by lily borer caterpillars, with the bulb tunics sometimes infested with mealy bug. These can be treated by over the counter insecticides or home remedies.",,,,The bulb is extremely poisonous.,,,,
Disa tripetaloides,Disa tripetaloides,,"Disa tripetaloides is a slender plant, 100-600 mm high. Plants develop a network of underground stems (stolons), forming dense clumps. The stolons are protection against floods, hence the dense populations found along stream banks. The 6-10 leaves are small, 6-140 mm long and form a basal rosette.

The colour and the shape of the flower vary depending on the locality. The flowers are usually white with various shades of pink. The yellow form is rare and found in the Eastern Cape (Transkei). The flower fades to a lighter pink as it ages. The flowering stem is 150-250 mm long and develops from the centre of the plant. Flowers, 7-10, are carried closely or spaced out on the stem. Flowers are 25 mm wide and resupinate, meaning the lip faces downwards. The hooded dorsal (maiden) sepal, lateral sepals and petals are white and often dotted with purple spots.

It flowers from November to January from Western Cape to the southern part of the Eastern Cape. In the summer rainfall areas of the Eastern Cape to the southern part of Kwazulu-Natal, flowering occurs from June to September.

","Bergius described the genus Disa in 1767. The genus consists of 162 species. It occurs throughout Africa, Madagascar, Reunion, and a large number of species are found in south central and South Africa. In 1981, the genus Disa was taxonomically revised by H.P. Linder.","Disa tripetaloides is found growing in Table Mountain Sandstone habitats from the Hottentots Holland Mountains to KwaZulu-Natal. It occurs along fast-flowing perennial streams, mountain seeps and on banks and often submerged in nutrient-poor water during winter. Disa uniflora is the most well-known species, and known as the red disa, flower of the gods, or the pride of Table Mountain. It bears the largest flowers in bright red to orange, carried on a flowering stem up to 600 mm long. Other evergreen species growing along stream banks, seepage areas and near waterfalls are D. aurata, D. cardinalis, D. caulescens, D. racemosa and D. venosa. They do not occur together but grow in similar conditions at different altitudes. The Mountain Butterfly, Meneris tulbaghia, which is attracted to the colour red, pollinates Disa uniflora.

Disa tripetaloides, a winter rainfall species, occurs from sea level to an altitude of 1000 m. During the rainy season, plants are often found growing in cold, nutrient-poor water. In summer when temperatures are warmer, moist air is carried from the sea and rises over the peaks of mountain ranges. Clouds develop and the moisture from the clouds gives water to the streams.

The fleshy roots of the plant act as a storage tuber, helping the plant to beat drought during the dry summer season. It does not tolerate severe frost.",,"Disa tripetaloides grows in full sun on mountain slopes and similar conditions should be maintained in cultivation (nurseries). The ideal temperature in greenhouses is 24Â°C. Plants can tolerate winter temperatures of between 5-15Â°C and summer temperatures should not exceed 30Â°C. To keep the greenhouse cool, hose it down with water. It is important in cultivation to keep the soil and roots cool. Do not allow plants to dry out. Optimum humidity is 60%. Good air movement is essential, as hot, dry air or winds are fatal to the plants. During the spring and summer (growing season) exposure to bright light or filtered sunlight contributes to healthy plants and flower colour development. Place the plants on benches or metal racks erected against the wall to hold drip trays covered with shade cloth.

Plants are grown in 10-15 cm pots, filled with a well-drained soil medium of silica grit, palm peat and sand. A coarse medium encourages good drainage and prevents waterlogging. A layer of stone chips is placed at the bottom of the pot to encourage good drainage and aeration. Watering should be done early in the morning. The pH value of the water ranges between 5 and 6 (acidic) and should be low in salt. Watering depends on the season. In summer, water 3 to 4 times a week and in winter watering is reduced to twice a week, preventing fungal and bacterial rot. Ordinary tap water can be used, ensure it is not heavily chlorinated. Fill a bucket of water overnight to allow chlorine to evaporate before use. Over-watering can result in a soggy medium causing root rot. Apply overhead watering, using a hand-held hose, sprinkler or watering can.

Feed plants during the active growing season (early spring to summer) as temperature and light intensity increase vegetative growth and photosynthesis. Feed with an inorganic fertilizer. Apply a foliar feed once a month. At this stage, plants absorb more nutrients, mature, and become more vigorous and robust. After the flowering spike emerges, the plant develops a new tuber. After the flowers have died, the flower stem turns yellow and dies back and the excess nutrients are absorbed by the replacement tubers.

The tuber takes about three months to develop healthy roots and leaves. The new plant will flower in the next season. Its survival depends on the development of the tuber and over-feeding prevents it from developing. Stop feeding it once the flowers have wilted. Excessive application of nitrogen is detrimental, causing the plant to develop weak flowering stems, lax and soft growth.

Re-pot in autumn once the flower stalk has died and new growth is vigorous. Remove old soil, decaying roots and the old tuber, wash in a fungicide, add new soil and water.

Disa tripetaloides produces stolons (underground stems) which give rise to new plants and tubers. Plants form clumps of 4-6 individuals that can be divided during re-potting.

Sow seeds in autumn on washed peat or sphagnum moss. Fill the bottom of the pot with a layer of stone chips, a mixture of silica grit, sand and peat and top up with a layer of peat. Water well and sow a thin layer of seeds on the surface. Spray with a suitable fungicide, e.g. Kaptan. Use clear plastic to cover the pot, held in place with a rubber band, or use a clear pane of glass. Place in a shady position and germination will take place after four weeks.

Keep medium moist, by placing the pot in a tray of water. Pots can also be soaked in a bucket of water, but do not allow the seeds to float in the water, or use a spraying can. Regular inspection will detect any fungal infection or diseases and treat with an appropriate fungicide. Remove the plastic cover or glass gradually as the young seedlings develop. Once the covering is removed and plants have adapted to the environment, prick out the seedlings and pot. Transfer the year-old seedlings into a fresh medium consisting of equal parts coarse river sand and peat and keep under shade; they will grow rapidly during the second year. The first flower forms during the third year. Re-pot every year.

Aphids, red spider mite, caterpillars and gall midge fly are common pests of disas and are treated successfully using the correct insecticides and application rates. The presence of red spider mite and thrips indicate that the environment is too warm for the disas. A cooler environment will reduce their activity. Warm, dry, humid conditions cause diseases such as crown rot and damping off-treat with a suitable fungicide. Keeping the environment clean, removing dead or rotted leaves and avoiding over-watering will reduce pest and disease attacks.",It is illegal to remove any indigenous orchids including Disa species from the wild; South African law protects them. Permission to collect orchids requires a permit from the relevant Nature Conservation authorities.,,,,,,,
Moraea polystachya,Moraea polystachya,,"Moraea polystachya and M. venenata are both perennial geophytes, the leaves and aerial stems dying back to the large dark-coated corm during the period of dormancy following flowering and seeding.

The two species are not easy to distinguish: the leaves are 3-5 or 6 in number, long and strap-shaped, flat or slightly U-shaped and slightly twisted spirally; in Moraea polystachya they are about 6-12 mm wide with unthickened margins, whereas in M. venenata they are 10-30 mm wide, often with the lowest two close together to form a cup-like structure at the base of the stem and with the margins thickened and yellowish.

The flowering stem averages about 0.8 m tall in M. polystachya and 0.25 m tall in M. venenata, although well-grown plants can be much taller. The flowering stem is many-branched at the top, and although each flower lasts only one day, a succession of flowers is produced so that the flowering period may last for six to eight weeks.

The upright flowers are relatively unspecialized in the genus, with an outer ring of three large more-or-less spoon-shaped tepals, and an inner ring of three smaller and narrower tepals. In the outer or both rings, the tepals curve outward or downward from the point where they broaden. As mentioned above, flower colour ranges from dark blue through violet (with pinkish tones) to white with fine blue lines, to pure white. One or both tepal rings have yellow to orange nectar guides at the base of each tepal. M. polystachya has smaller flowers, with the outer tepals about 50 mm long, in contrast to those of M. venenata where the outer tepals may be up to 60 mm long. In the centre, is the self-coloured (same colour as tepals), complex expanded style structure, similar to that of the cultivated iris, which crowns the ovary and hides the stamens. In M. polystachya the ovary usually protrudes from the floral bracts and develops into a rounded capsule, 11-16 mm long; in M. venenata, the ovary is concealed by the floral bracts and develops into an oblong capsule, 16-20 mm long. The capsule splits open when mature to release many small angular, pale brown seeds.","Moraea polystachya was described (as Iris polystachya ) by Thunberg, the 'father of Cape botany', in 1782, from a collection he had made in the Eastern Cape 'in the area of the Sundays and Fish Rivers'. The species name polystachya, meaning many-branched, refers to the inflorescence, which differed greatly from the few-flowered species of the Western Cape already known to Thunberg. Its toxicity was mentioned by Ecklon, another famous botanical explorer, as early as 1830. M. venenata was only described from Namibia in 1924, but has had a chequered taxonomic history as it was not always recognized as a separate species from M. polystachya. The species name venenata means poisonous, referring to the very toxic nature of the plants.","Neither Moraea polystachya nor M. venenata is threatened or protected in any way; in fact the opposite applies and these plants are generally viewed as undesirable in agricultural land.

Moraea polystachya is widespread in central South Africa and Namibia, but its range overlaps that of M. venenata in Namibia and Northern Cape, South Africa. The average annual rainfall ranges from 100 to 700 mm, and is probably considerably less in a 'normal' year. In part of their common range, the sparse rainfall occurs in summer, while the remainder of the range receives rain in winter. The habitat is well-drained flats and slight slopes, with collectors often referring to the presence of calcrete deposits. Light frost occurs, but in mid-summer (when the plants are dormant) the temperatures may regularly exceed 40º C. Another closely-related, large blue-flowered species is Moraea speciosa, which occurs on the southern and western margins of the Karoo and could be confused with M. venenata when not in flower, on account of its several broad leaves with thickened margins. When in flower, it is not possible to confuse them: M. speciosa has pale blue, cup-shaped flowers with large nectar guides and which usually face to the side when open. The style structure is very different. Two distantly related species, M. amissa and M. gigandra, have already been discussed in this series.","The dried plant material is also toxic and when accidentally incorporated in hay can have disastrous results. A few cases of fatal human poisoning have been reported, where the corms were mistaken for those of edible species, such as Moraea fugax. The toxin has been identified as a cardiac glycoside (heart-poison).","Moraea polystachya is easy and rewarding to grow, but because it has a tendency to become weedy in cultivation, grow plants in pots or in a rockery where they can be controlled. For the best show, mass the plants together.

Plant the corms at a depth of two to three times their diameter in a well-drained soil mixture. Water lightly until after sprouting, when watering can be increased, but never over-water. Fertilize sparingly. Protect the corms from freezing during dormancy.

Sow seed in late summer or autumn. Seed germinates readily, and the same rules for watering and fertilizing apply. Seedlings flower in about three years.

Possible pests are red spider mite and aphids.",,,,"The dried plant material is also toxic and when accidentally incorporated in hay can have disastrous results.

Cephalophyllum parviflorum,Cephalophyllum parviflorum,,"Cephalophyllum parviflorum is a succulent, perennial, ground cover, with small, triangular, spotted leaves that are arranged on the main stem decussately (with opposite pairs), with leaves 80 mm long and 8 mm in diameter. The stems consist of long nodes and internodes, with heads of crowded leaves.

Usually 3 yellow flowers, sometimes 2 or 1 per plant, flower in July. Flowers consist of long pedicels, with 5 sepals covering the ovary, many, linear, free (not fused) petals and many, erect, free stamens. The top of inferior ovary forms a fleshy rim around the base of the stigmas. Occasionally they have 15 to 20, plumose (feathery) stigmas at the center of the capsule.

The capsules of Aizoaceae have a complicated structure, more so than any other family. Plants of this genus have an opening and closing mechanism, which comes into play in wet and dry conditions, for seed exposure and dispersal. When the seeds are ripe and the capsule is moistened, the capsule opens, exposing the seeds, but due to the elastic covering membrane of the locules, the seeds are exposed, but not released for the first few rains, until the covering membrane opens, whereby the capsules totally disintegrate, releasing the seeds; this can sometimes happen after several years, or after continuous rains (H. Herre 1971). Fruit capsule have valve and valve wings, opening keels, covering membranes and 8 to 20 locules, with small, ovate to pear-shaped, brown to light brown seeds.","Cephalophyllum is derived from the Greek word kephale meaning ‘head’ and phyllon meaning ‘leaf’ (H. Herre 1971); the leaves may be oppositely arranged, forming a head-like ball. The specific epithet parviflorum, is from parvus meaning ‘small’ and floris meaning ‘flower’ = small flower. There are 63 species recorded for this genus from Namibia and the Cape Province: the Richtersveld, Namaqualand, Bushmanland, and the Karroo and Little Karroo in the southwestern Cape.","Cephalophyllum parviflorum has been given a threat status of CR (Critically Endangered), and it is of high conservation concern to prevent it from extinction. This species is known from five locations, three of these populations are extinct and two are continuing to decline, because of ongoing habitat loss, due to urban development and farming.

The Tygerberg trailing-vygie has a very restricted distribution and only known from a few very specific populations in the southwestern Cape, from Saldanha to Milnerton and found on rocky outcrops on Renosterveld, with an average annual rainfall of 467 mm. A common trait of succulents is the ability to store water in the leaves, which is a distinct adaptation of plants growing in dry areas. The bright yellow flowers open during midday allowing pollinators such as bees, to pollinate. The seeds are dispersed by water during rain, when the rain makes the capsules wet, causing it to expand and open, releasing seeds that are the carried by little water streams during rains.",,"Plant C. parviflorum in semi-shade to full sunny areas in your garden, preferably in rocky areas with a good drainage, mimicking the wild habitat. It has potential in hanging baskets and can be an excellent trailing pot plant for the horticultural trade. C. parviflorum is relatively easy to grow from either seed sowing or cutting. It is a plant that gives a gardener a burst of confidence.

There are two methods to propagate this species vegetatively:

When fully rooted, separate the plants and transplant them into individual small pots. In three to four weeks you can transplant them into larger pots, as they do not have massive root systems, or plant them directly in the garden in a suitable place.

To grow from seed collect the capsules when they are dry from August to September; clean the seeds and sow them in May. Sow seeds in a shallow seed tray with coarse sand, level sand surface area without compacting. Apply pre-emergent fungicide to prevent fungal infection to the seed, Scatter the seeds evenly on the surface and cover lightly with sand and preferably apply a treatment such as smoke disc to increase germination rate.",,,,,,,,
Erica diaphana,Erica diaphana,,"Erica diaphana is as an erect shrub, up to 1.8 m tall, with rigid, spreading branches. Leaves are 4–6 mm long, thick and smooth, upright to spreading, and in threes. The flowers are pendulous and appear to be suspended from the branches, and are also produced in threes. The flowers are large, 20–24 mm long, shiny and very sticky, pale pink to purplish, semi-transparent tubes with white to greenish tips. The green tips fade as the flower ages. At the base of the corolla tubes are leaf-like sepals and bracts. The stamens do not protrude from the tip of the corolla tube (the term for this is included), but the stigma does (is exserted). The shadow of the anthers can be seen through the semi-transparent corolla tube as a dark ring towards the tip. Erica diaphana flowers in mid- to late summer (December to March).","What is an Erica? In the field, it is said, that the one major character to look for is the small, narrow, folded leaves, described as ‘ericoid’. Dating back to the time of the ancient Greek civilization when Theophrastus and Pliny walked the earth, you would have heard them use the term erike, as they described the heath-like shrubs around them. In 458 BC, Aeschylus wrote a play called Agamemnon in which the fall of Troy is told to have been signaled from the mountain tops by the light of the fires of dried ereika. Ereiko means to break, which may describe the plant’s brittle stems that would easily split with a little force. A number of references, though, suggest that ereiko describes the plant’s ability to break up bladder stones, once an infusion of the leaves was ingested (Hyam & Pankhurst 1995). The name of this species, diaphana, is from Ancient Greek διαφανής (diafanēs) or the Latin diaphanus which means ‘transparent’ or ‘translucent’, and describes the semi-transparent corolla tubes.","As South Africans we are custodians of the world’s richest temperate flora. We can say this confidently because of the 370 000 species of mosses, ferns and seed plants currently estimated to exist on our planet; 20 456 species are recorded here. Of this number 65% (13 256 species) occur nowhere else in the world. This is astounding when you consider that South Africa only accounts for 2.5% of the world’s land surface! So, what we have is precious.

Erica diaphana is currently red listed as LC (Least Concern), meaning that it is not threatened. However, this South African endemic has not yet been fully assessed and was therefore given an automatic status of Least Concern. The Threatened Species Programme is currently completing full assessments for all taxa with an automated status, so, this status may change in future.

Erica diaphana is endemic to South Africa. It grows on flats and rocky slopes to high altitudes, from the Bontebok National Park near Swellendam, eastwards to George, Humansdorp and Uitenhage and inland to the the Outeniqua and Tsitsikamma Mountains, Langkloof and Baviaanskloof, of the Eastern and Western Cape.",,"Grow Erica diaphana in a sunny position where there is good air circulation, in a sandy, well-drained soil. Ericas grow better when planted close together and with other fynbos plants to form dense stands that cover the ground. Erica diaphana is well suited to fynbos gardens, Mediterranean gardens, coastal gardens, although not in the dunes or in the salt-spray zone, in mixed shrubbery, rockeries, on sloping ground, terraced areas or retaining walls, and it will do well in containers. It is a strong grower. Fertilise with well-rotted compost applied as a mulch in autumn and spring. A low-dose or slow-release fertiliser can also be used, but avoid strong fertilisers and manure.

Erica diaphana can be grown from seed or cuttings, however, cuttings are easier and faster to grow and produce plants that are more robust. Plants grown from cuttings can be transplanted within six months, as opposed to a year for seed-grown plants, and they will flower a year earlier.

Sow seed in late summer or autumn. Treating the seed with Instant Smoke Plus Seed Primer improves germination. Use a well-drained, sandy, slightly acidic medium. Seed is very fine and need not to be covered. Use a fine gentle spray when watering and keep the trays moist and warm. Seed germinates in about six weeks and the young seedlings are very tiny and delicate. Prick them out when they are 1 cm tall. Feed weekly with a dilute fertiliser. The seedlings are slow growing and need at least a year’s growing time before they are large enough to be planted out.

Take 20–30 mm cuttings from semi-hard wood, two months after flowering, from healthy mature plants. Heel and stem cuttings work best. Remove the leaves from the lower third of the cutting, dip into a rooting hormone and place into a tray filled with 50% peat, or milled pine bark, and 50% polystyrene. Place the trays in a propagation unit with overhead mist and bottom heating of between 22–24°C. Once the cuttings are rooted, pot them up into ½ litre plastic bags. Young cuttings must be watered well and kept under shade for a month, after which they are placed into full sun, and can be planted out after 3–4 months.

Ericas are sensitive about soil. Use a potting medium that is well drained and acidic, containing no manure, and with low levels of phosphate. A well-drained, sandy loam with a pH between 5 and 5.5, containing about 50% humus, is ideal.",,,,,,,,
Leucadendron laureolum,Leucadendron laureolum,light fruity scent ,"Leucadendron laureolum is a large shrub 1 to 2 m tall and single-stemmed at the base. It is dioecious, meaning that there are separate male and female plants. Male bushes are compact, rounded and yellowish. Female bushes are more sparsely branched, bare-stemmed and greenish. Both turn bright yellow during the winter (June-July-August) flowering season. Leaves are oblong and hairless when mature and end in a blunt, recurved, fine point. Leaves on male bushes are up to 75 mm long and 15 mm wide, on female bushes up to 95 mm long and 17 mm wide.

Male flowerheads are packed full of small yellow flowers, forming an elongated globe up to 25 mm long and 14 mm wide and silky at the tip. Female flowerheads are made up of green scales with fewer yellow flowers dotted among them, forming an elongated globe up to 27 mm long and 14 mm wide. Flowering season is winter (July) and the flowerheads are lightly fruit-scented. The leaves that surround the flowerheads, known as the involucral leaves, turn bright yellow during the flowering season and conceal the flowerheads.

After flowering, the male flowerheads turn brown and drop off, but the female ones continue to grow, forming greenish yellow cones up to 46 mm long and 37 mm wide. The cones are retained on the bush for several years, becoming hard and woody. Seeds, or more correctly the fruits, are only released when the cone dries out, usually after the parent plant, or branch, dies. The fruits are winged.","The genus name Leucadendron is derived from the Greek leukos, meaning white, and dendron, tree; named after the most outstanding member of the genus, the Silver Tree, Leucadendron argenteum, on which the genus was based. In the 1690s when the genus was first named it was known as the Witteboom, meaning 'white tree'. The specific name means 'like a small laurel', from the Latin laureolus and refers to the leaves.","Least Concern. Leucadendron laureolum is not threatened. This species has lost some of its populations, mostly on the Cape Flats, to urban development and on the Agulhas Plain to invasive alien plants and agriculture, however, its remaining populations are dense and extensive and adequately conserved.

Leucadendron laureolum occurs on granite, sandstone and limestone slopes and flats, most often on deep sands, from sea level to 1000 m from the Cape Peninsula eastwards to Potberg, north-east to Jonaskop and northwards to Paarl Mountain. Within this area it is found on the Cape Flats, Hottentots Holland Mountains, Kogelberg, Kleinmond, Groenland, Kleinrivier and Babylontoring Mountains, Elim Flats, Riviersonderend Mountains, Caledon Swartberg and Bredasdorp. It occurs in large, dense communities. The genus Leucadendron belongs in the protea family. It consists of 83 species, most of which occur in the Western and Eastern Cape with a few outliers in KwaZulu-Natal. They are all dioecious shrubs or trees, and are known as conebushes because the female flower heads form woody cones in which the fruits are borne. Leucadendron laureolum is serotinous, and retains its seeds in woody cone-like fruits on the female plants for several years. Plants are killed by fire, but the seeds are protected inside the cones. After the fire, the cones open and release the seeds, which germinate en masse with the autumn-winter rains. Seeds are winged and are dispersed by wind.

Like all members of the protea family, this species has proteoid roots, which are dense clusters of hairy rootlets with a surface area 15 times that of non-proteoid roots. Proteoid roots are formed in a 50 mm root mat around the plant in the soil just beneath the leaf litter, where nutrient supply is the highest. In nature they are formed only during the rainy season, but in cultivation where water is provided all year round they are formed throughout the year. They also form more readily in soil that has added compost (humus or leaf mould).

Proteoid roots are not formed in soil that has been fertilised with high levels of phosphates (P). Proteoid roots are an adaptation to the nutrient-poor soils found in the Cape mountains and allow the plants to absorb the tiny amounts of nutrients available in the soils. This adaptation makes them difficult in cultivation as they cannot cope with heavily fertilised soils.

Leucadendron laureolum has relatively large, nutrient-rich seeds, which give the seedlings a competitive advantage in nutrient-poor soils. Using the stored nitrogen and phosphate in the seed, the seedling can establish itself in soil where these nutrients are critically scarce, and survive long enough for the proteoid roots to develop.",,"Leucadendron laureolum needs a sunny spot in well-drained soil. It is wind-tolerant, drought-tolerant when established, and thrives in nutrient-poor soils. It is well suited to fynbos gardens, Mediterranean gardens, coastal gardens, rockeries as well as gardens on sandy flats. It is also a good candidate for gardens where species of the protea family that need acidic soil have failed, as it tolerates a wider range of soil types than many other species. It is a large shrub, and thus needs about 2-4 m of space to develop to its full, rounded size.

Keep root disturbance to a minimum. The roots of proteaceous plants are very susceptible to fungal infection, so try not to break them by digging around the base of the plant inside the drip-line, rather put down a thick layer of mulch once or twice a year, e.g. in autumn and in spring, and leave them undisturbed. Proteas are light feeders with sensitive root systems that are adapted to very nutrient-poor soils and will be killed by strong fertilisers and manure.

Leucadendron laureolum is easily raised from seeds sown in autumn. Sow in sterile, well-drained soil, press the seeds into the surface and cover with clean sand or fine-milled bark and keep moist but not wet. Seeds germinate in 4-8 weeks. Treating the seed with a fungicide increases the number of surviving seedlings. Transplant into individual containers filled with well-drained soil mix as soon as the first pair of true leaves has developed. Grow on for a year before planting out into the garden.

This species can also be propagated by semi-hardwood cuttings taken from the current season's growth, in autumn or spring. Remove the leaves from the basal third of the cutting, treat with a rooting hormone, and place in well-drained rooting medium under intermittent mist with bottom heat of 24 °C. Rooting takes about 6 weeks; harden off for 3 weeks and transplant into individual containers filled with well-drained soil.","Although not widely cultivated for the cutflower or horticulture market, Leucadendron laureolum is one of the parents of many commercial hybrids such as 'Asteroid', 'Chameleon', 'Red Gem', 'Silvan Red', 'Safari Sunset', 'Inca Gold', 'Magenta Sunset', 'Laurel Yellow', 'Wilson's Wonder' and many more.",,,,,,,
Drosera cuneifolia,Drosera cuneifolia,,"Drosera cuneifolia is a perennial carnivorous plant. The basal rosette is loosely clumped and formed by quite broad, wedge-shaped leaves, 20-40 mm long and 10-15 mm wide. The leaves are greenish with 3-5 veins, and the lower leaf surface is almost smooth. Both marginal and discal tentacles are present. The dense marginal tentacles are longer while the rest are shorter, red and knob-ended. The plants have a few, fairly long roots.

The flowering stalk is leafless, rarely branched and erect, originating from the centre of the rosette, 100-200 mm long and bears multiple pink to mauve flowers. The petals are 10-15 mm long. The styles are spoon-shaped. Flowering time: November to January. Black spindle-shaped seeds are formed in a capsule and released a few weeks after flowering.","The genus Drosera was named by Linnaeus in 1753, and consists of ± 126 species, of which 23 are known to occur in South Africa. Drosera gets its name from the Greek word, droseros, meaning dewy. The epithet cuneifolia refers to the wedged-shaped leaves.

Drosera cuneifolia was first described in 1781 by Carl Linnaeus the Younger (1741-1783), a Swedish naturalist and son of the famous systematist Carl Linnaeus.","Drosera cuneifolia is endemic to South Africa and restricted to the Table Mountain complex in the Western Cape. Plant colonies can usually be found in damp, peaty areas in seeps or exposed flat and sandy areas amongst fynbos vegetation at altitudes up to 915 m. They have been noted by T.M. Salter to occasionally grow on the flats south of Smitswinkel. Drosera cuneifolia is a winter-growing sundew and usually goes dormant during summer.

Flowers are open very briefly for a few hours with good sunlight. The flowers can be pollinated by insects, but are usually self-pollinated. When the seeds are ripe, their capsules open to release the fine, light-weight seeds which fall out and are dispersed near the parent plants.",,"Droseras make fascinating house and conservatory plants around the world, but are better suited to being grown outdoors. However, keep them under a roof if you wish to retain their vivid red colouration. Plants can be brought indoors for short periods for display. Drosera cuneifolia is a hardy winter-growing carnivorous plant, but not necessarily the easiest for novices.

A very well drained sandy soil is the best growth medium, 1 part silica grit to 1 part peat or sphagnum moss, in 9-15 cm pots is ideal. It is important not to over-pot plants. Taller rather than wider pots are ideal for Drosera to thrive and to accommodate their few, but long roots. Place the potted plants in a shallow saucer filled with fresh water to keep them moist at all times during their growth season. If using the saucer method, allow the saucer to dry out occasionally so that the medium can aerate. This will not harm your plants so long as the moisture content in the medium is still high. Place in a northern (in southern hemisphere) or eastern situation for best sunlight if growing indoors. Grow in full sun to light shade outdoors. During the plants' dormant period in summer, remove pots from water trays or saucer, but do not allow soil to dry completely. The author allows for very minimal, light watering over the dormant phase. This technique has successfully kept plants alive over their dormant period and allowed mature plants to resprout the following winter. Other growers recommend removing roots and tubers and keeping them in a sealed container in a cool environment.

Sundews are easily propagated by seed. In autumn prepare a 90 mm pot with growth medium; water well. Sow fresh seeds on the surface of moist growth medium. Do not cover the seeds with soil. Place in a warm, semi-shady position, and seeds should germinate in 2-4 weeks. If the seed sown is too dense, the seedlings or groups of seedlings can be transplanted into their own containers to reduce the chance of dampening off, once large enough to handle safely.

Acidic or epiphytic foliar feed may be used at ¼ recommended strength once a month on mature plants.

Ironically, the carnivorous plants are attacked by insect pests. Aphids, mealy bug and thrips cause deformity in new growth. Treat with a diluted pesticide or remove pests by hand. Never use a soap-based insecticide. Drying out can cause drooping and the decrease in mucilage production. Watering and keeping the plant moist will revive them. Dew production may stop after transplanting or if the leaf comes into contact with inquisitive hands or chemical applications. New foliage will, however, grow and continue to produce dew.","Probably the most interesting characteristic of this plant is its ability to digest the nutrients, especially the nitrogen, it requires from insects caught in its stalked tentacles. Different types of glandular growths include marginal tentacles situated near the lamina (leaf blade) margins, discal tentacles which are shorter and disc-like, usually on the upper leaf surfaces, digestive glands filled with red fluid, and glandular hair-like growths on the inflorescence. The tentacles are sensitive and mobile. Their stalks end in a bulbous head in which the glandular cells occur. These glands secret a glistening, sticky, clear fluid used to trap and retain prey. There is speculation that the fluid is slightly sweetly scented to attract insects. The fluid contains a weak acid and enzymes that digest the soft parts of the prey. The sensitive tentacles are able to detect caught prey and produce more dew to entrap their victim. Neighbouring tentacles then mobilize and slowly lean over to engulf the hapless victim. The lamina itself may also fold over to enclose or suffocate larger prey and allow for better absorption. As sensitive as these tentacles are, they are able to distinguish between a meal and other stimuli, for example, they do not respond to water droplets.",,,,,,,
Encephalartos eugene-maraisii,Encephalartos eugene-maraisii,"Cycads use smells and heat to attract and repel insect pollinators. The plants heat up and produce a strong odour that drives the pollen-covered insects out of the cones of male cycads. The female cones then attract these same insects with a milder, more alluring odour. ","Encephalartos eugene-maraisii has a medium-sized to large cycad with an erect, aerial stem that sometimes becomes procumbent with age. The stem can usually grow up to about 4m long and 0.45 m in diameter with soft whitish cataphylls at the crown of the stem.

Leaves are rigid, up to 0.7-1.5 m long, light bluish green, and slightly curved downwards with the leaf tip usually curved slightly upwards. Median leaflets are about 150-200mm long and 13-18 mm in diameter. Leaflets are leathery and without nodules. Leaflet margins are not thickened and entire except for the occasional single tooth on the lower margin. Basal leaflets decrease in size to one or two spines at most.

Male and female plants produce cones in December which are reddish-brown due to a dense layer of hairs which covers the greenish-grey underlying part of the cone. Male plants bear 1-8 cones per season per stem. They are 200-450 mm long and 60-100mm long in diameter. They often emit a strong odour during pollen shedding which normally takes place from February to March. Female plants bear 1-6 cones per season per stem. They are 300-500mm long and 160-200mm in diameter. The female cones of Encephalartos eugene-maraisii do not disintegrate spontaneously, but dry out from May to August. They produce seeds which are light brown, 35-44mm long and 23-30mm in diameter.","The name Encephalartos is derived from the Greek en meaning 'within', kephali meaning 'head', and artos meaning 'bread'. Inez Clare Verdoorn described this species in 1945. The epithet is in honour of her uncle, Eugene Nielen Marais, the celebrated author, poet and naturalist, who brought the species to the attention of the scientific community.","Encephalartos eugene-maraisii is closely related to several other species ( E. middelburgensis, E. dyerianus, E. dolomiticus and E. hirsutus ), but it is distinguished from the others by its straight leaves that recurve at their ends, spineless median leaflets, clear petiole, and green cones with a fine brown wool. According to Red List of South African Plants, Encephalartos eugene-maraisii is assessed as Endangered (EN), as the best available evidence indicates that it meets all five IUCN criteria for Endangered, and is therefore facing a very high risk of extinction in the wild.

This species is endemic to South Africa where it grows in the Waterberg and adjacent areas among low shrubs on rocky hills and steep slopes in open grassland and savanna. The Waterberg climate is hot in summer and very cold in winter. In their distribution area the annual rainfall is 600 to 750mm and falls predominantly in summer. This species is a relatively slow grower, very frost resistant and does best in full sunlight.",,"Encephalartos eugene-maraisii grows relatively slowly and does well in full sun. It is a very frost-hardy species. It is easily propagated from seeds and suckers (the young plants that grow around the main stem).

The seeds are collected, cleaned and stored in a brown paper bag at 10-15°C for six months or more, to allow the embryo to fully develop. The seeds are cleaned to ensure that all the flesh is removed, since it may contain germination inhibitors and can also promote the growth of fungi. The flesh is scraped away with a knife but protective gloves should be worn during the cleaning operation to prevent contact with the slow-acting poisons present in the flesh. If the flesh is hard and dry, it helps to soak the seeds in water for a day or two before cleaning. Even if the seeds have been cleaned, it is a good idea to soak them for a few days, preferably with daily changes of water, before planting them. When the seeds are placed in water, the viable ones will sink and the non-viable ones will float.

To germinate the seeds, place the cleaned seeds on their sides half buried on washed sand or potting mix, and keep at about 28°C. It is necessary to keep the medium moist, but not too wet, for as long as it takes for germination to take place. As soon as the radicals of the sprouted kernels are 10-20mm long, they can be planted singly in bags containing potting soil or some other suitable medium. Alternatively one can wait until the seedlings develop one or two leaves before transplanting them individually into bags.

Because cycad seedlings form long taproots, it is advisable to use tall narrow perforated black plastic bags about 240×120mm in size for their initial establishment. Place the seedlings under shade for the first few years of growth and development. Initially the seedlings must be watered daily with a fine spray. After about a month, as their roots elongate, the frequency of watering should be decreased to once a week. The seedlings can be transplanted into the garden when they are 3-5years old. When preparing to propagate from suckers, a hole should be dug around the stem of the mother plant to expose the base and roots of the suckers. One must use a clean sharp knife or sharp spade to remove the sucker from the mother plant. The wound should then be treated with a fungicide and dried for about a week before planting the sucker into a sterile medium.

Cycads are ideal for a low-maintenance garden, as they require a minimum of water and are undemanding in their soil and environmental needs.

Troublesome pests include scale insects, beetles and chewing insects. Scale insects cause great damage to cycad leaves by sucking the sap from them. Most scale insects can be controlled with regular and frequent applications of horticultural soluble oil such as white oil. Beetles seriously damage cycad plants by attacking the emerging young leaves. Control can be kept by application of contact or systemic insecticides, or one of the bacterial preparations available.",,,"Cycads can be used as decorative or focal point plants in gardens and can also be very effective as grouped plantings. In ancient times, people used to make bread out of the stem by scraping out the pith, burying it in the earth, and leaving it for about two months to rot. After two months it would be unearthed, kneaded, and made it into a bread for people to eat.",,,,,
Erica caterviflora,Erica caterviflora,strong honey scent,"Erica caterviflora has a very limited distribution. It is an unusual erica as it assumes different growth forms depending upon where it grows. It may grow into a small tree, as a lithophyte (cliff-loving), or it can be stunted and bonsai-like.

Large specimens have trunks up to about 150 mm in diameter, grow up to 5 m tall and produce wiry branches that spread about 4 m wide. The majority of specimens, however, form large shrubs between 2 and 4 m tall. Quite a few plants were found growing out of crevices in the cliff face. These cliff-loving plants (lithophytes) grow happily in this cool, shaded, moist habitat although they are much smaller and stunted. A few plants were seen growing on boulders that had fallen from the cliff. These plants were severely stunted with thick, gnarled trunks and a growth habit much like bonsai plants.

Erica caterviflora is an erect, well-branched, woody plant with greyish brown, flaky bark. The leaves are dark green and densely packed around the stems and branches, producing a soft textural effect.

It produces short, tubular or urn-shaped flowers that range from pink to pale pink or white. The flowers are numerous and densely packed in congested clusters at the ends of branches. The flowers of this species are covered with fine hairs, but there is another far less common variety, E. caterviflora var. glabrata, which is hairless (glabrous). Flowers are produced from January to March and are honey-scented. Numerous small seeds are produced in small lobed capsules from February to May.

Erica caterviflora is a very slow growing, long-lived species. It grows in seldom-burnt microhabitats that allow it to grow undisturbed for long periods of time. It is very difficult to guess age, but mature specimens have been estimated to be well over 100 years old.","This erica owes its name to the Latin word caterva, which means a crowd or group, referring to the crowded arrangement of its flowers at the ends of branches.","Endangered.

Erica caterviflora is a narrow endemic with a very limited distribution on cool, moist, shaded, upper-middle, south-facing slopes of Table Mountain. It was believed to have become extinct in the early 1990s when the last known plant was trampled. The specialized niche habitat where this plant grows protects it from fire. The main threat to this species is from trampling, as the lush vegetation in its habitat is highly susceptible to too frequent traffic. The best way to protect the species is to not advertise its locality and to have experts monitor the population every few years.

Erica caterviflora grows at the base of or on moist south-facing cliffs on Table Mountain. Five separate, but closely situated populations have been found amounting to a total of approximately 270 plants.

This plant survives in cool, windy areas where it is often blanketed by southeaster clouds during the hot summer months. The soils are rocky, well-drained and nutrient poor. It normally grows up against or near cliffs where it gets plenty of moisture and very little direct sunlight. At best, specimens receive about 2 hours direct sunlight each day in midsummer and some none at all. Specimens growing in sunnier positions away from cliffs were stunted, yellow and showing signs of stress.

Average temperatures where it grows probably range from about 4 -15 ºC with upper temperatures rarely exceeding 20 ºC. It experiences winter rainfall with an annual average of ± 1800 mm.

Plants grown at Kirstenbosch from an old collection have been difficult to grow and maintain as good specimens. Fresh cuttings taken from vigorously growing plants in habitat have proved much easier to grow. Plants need to be grown in containers and kept in a cool place under shade. An interesting discovery was made while doing field assessments of the population size of this species. We found that this species is able to regenerate from seed in mature vegetation without the intervention of fire. The theory that no fire in fynbos is detrimental to the long-term survival of species does not apply to Erica caterviflora.

The flowers emit a strong honey scent, but no bees were seen visiting the plants. There were, however, hundreds of cave flies attending the flowers and they are probably responsible for pollination. It appears to produce relatively little seed despite the numerous flowers. Seeds germinate in any nook and cranny within the cool shaded habitat and very few plants are found away from cliffs in direct sunlight. The species appears to be able to survive for long periods growing in niche habitats where there is little soil. It is a reseeder and not a resprouter.",,"This species has been grown as a potplant at the Kirstenbosch Nursery and is also grown by one other specialist grower. Fresh semi-hardwood tip or heel cuttings are used, but it is not easy to root. Cuttings are rooted in multi-trays on heated benches under mist spray. The best time to root erica cuttings is late summer/autumn or spring.

Cuttings are rooted in bark and polystyrene, using a rooting hormone for semi-hardwood cuttings. We have not sown seeds of this species.

Erica caterviflora will not thrive in gardens and should only be grown as a pot plant by garden enthusiasts skilled in growing difficult plants. It is very slow growing and only produces short spurts of growth at a time. Feed with an organic liquid or pellet fertilizer.

Potting soil should be acidic, sandy and well drained. Mix a combination of equal parts composted pine bark or pine needles and river sand. A little loam (20%) may also be added.

Pests do not present a major problem, but watch out for aphids on new growth and mealy bug.",,,,,,,,
Agathosma gonaquensis,Agathosma gonaquensis,,"Agathosma gonaquensis is a single-stemmed, slow-growing, evergreen shrub, reaching a height of 0.5-1 m. It has a spreading habit, and a rounded shape. The leaves are small, dark green 6-9 mm long, crowded and alternately arranged on the stems.

The flower heads consist of 1-12 white flowers packed into dense, rounded heads measur ing 5 mm in diameter. The flowering season is late winter, spring to midsummer (July until December).

The fruit has a three-chambered seed capsule with one shiny black seed in each chamber. The seed capsule turns from green to brown as it matures. The seed is released and scattered over a distance (known as ballistic dispersal or catapult mechanism).","Agathosma is derived from the Greek word agathos meaning pleasant, and osme meaning scent, and refers to the fragrant oil glands on the leaves and fruit. The species name is derived from the Gonaqua, a group of Khoikhoi-Xhosa, who inhabited the area inland of Algoa Bay where this species occurs.","Agathosma gonaquensis is Critically Endangered (CR). Herbarium records show that this species was once common around Port Elizabeth. Today, only two small and severely fragmented subpopulations survive. Most of its habitat has been destroyed by urban development. The wild population continues to decline due to alien plants invading what remains of its habitat, and ongoing urban development.

Agathosma gonaquensis occurs naturally in coastal grassland with fynbos elements, from Uitenhage to Port Elizabeth in the Eastern Cape. The genus Agathosma consists of 150 species found mainly in the Western Cape.",,"Buchus can be successfully grown from seed or cuttings. Seed harvested for sowing should not be picked too early, as the embryo is not fully developed. Seed will not be viable and germination percentage will be low. Do a test by pressing the seed capsule between your fingers. If it feels hard and not soft and it is dark green or brown, it is ready for picking. The capsules disperse the seeds explosively, so place seed capsules in a closed paper bag for drying and storage.

Seed ripens in summer (October to December). Fresh buchu seed is sown in autumn (March to April). The seeds are sown into a tray containing a well-drained medium of equal portions of sand, loam and compost. Use some of the medium to cover the seed and water. Place in a covered area with good light and air circulation. Keep medium-damp. Germination occurs in one to two months.

Young seedlings are pricked out into 0.5 l bags when four true leaves have developed. Use a medium suitable for fynbos. Feed plants regularly but sparingly with a well-balanced fertilizer. Pinch out the growing tips of the seedlings to encourage bushy growth. Flowers are produced after two years.

Cuttings After flowering, plants develop new shoots or branches, which are ideal for tip, stem or heel cuttings. Collect plant material early in the morning to reduce stress. Cuttings have the advantage of producing a larger flowering plant quicker than seedlings. Tip cuttings, 50-70 mm, are taken from the current year's growth. Prepare cuttings by making a clean cut below the node and remove a third of the foliage. Dip the base of the cutting in a rooting hormone. Firmly place the cuttings in a medium of 50% bark and 50% polystyrene and water cuttings with a fungicide. Ideally these cuttings should now be placed in a well-aerated propagation unit with a bottom heat of 24ºC. Rooting occurs in 9 to 11 weeks. Carefully pot the rooted cuttings using a well-drained, humus-rich, fynbos potting medium (2 parts leaf mould, 1 part coarse sand). Plants will be ready for planting in 7 to 8 months, ideally during autumn to spring. Feed regularly with a well-balanced nutrient. Yellow leaves can be treated with an application of iron chelate.

Cultivation Agathosma gonaquensis is best planted into the garden during autumn, winter and spring. The rainy season allows buchus to establish themselves in the garden and to cope with drought and less water during summer. Once established they will withstand a fair amount of frost. Plant buchus in your garden where they will receive full sun, in soil that is alkaline to acid, well drained and composted. Before planting, prepare the garden bed by digging over the soil, adding compost and a slow-release fertilizer. Water the garden area before planting. Plant them with medium-sized plants, in groups of 3, 5 or 9, 20-30 cm apart, with enough space to encourage growth. Water well after planting. Plants require good watering in winter and moderate watering in summer. Do not allow plants to dry out and avoid cultivating the soil around the roots of these fynbos plants. They are slow-growing plants and should not be planted too close to faster growing plants. A layer of mulch is added after planting and annually to keep soil and roots cool in summer. Mulch retains soil moisture and reduces germination of weed seeds.

Agathosma qonaquensis, as well as most of species found in Rutaceae family, are water-wise. The Gonaqua buchu can be used as an accent plant in a mixed fynbos bed or in a coastal garden with companion plants such as Leucospermum cordifolium (pincushion), Protea neriifolia (oleander leaf protea), Erica patersonii (mielie heath), Elegia tectorum (Cape thatching reed) and herbaceous perennials such as Felicia aethiopica, Leonotis leonurus (wild dagga), and Dietes bicolor (yellow wild iris). Buchus provide colour, fragrance and attract insects to the garden. Interplant with other interesting buchu species such as Acmadenia heterophylla, Adenandra uniflora (china flower), Agathosma mucronulata (false buchu) and Diosma prama. It is suitable in a rockery in between rocks or used as a container plant.",,,"Agathosma betulina (round leaf buchu) and Agathosma crenulata (long leaf buchu) are commercially grown for their oil content. The oil is used in the manufacturing of cosmetics, soaps and medicinally for its antiseptic and diuretic properties.

Buchus such as Agathosma glabrata, A. lanceolata (honey buchu) and A. ovata 'Kluitjieskraal'. can be used in any garden as fillers, in a mixed fynbos bed or in a herbaceous border. Traditionally, Agathosma qonaquensis is used as an infusion for hay fever and colds.",,,,,
Colchicum,Colchicum,,"Species of the genus Colchicum are short-stemmed or stemless reaching a the height of 150 mm. All species have an ovoid corm (a corm unlike a bulb, is a stem that is swollen and modified for storage, flattened on top and slightly concave on the bottom: when upon being cut, the corm appears solid). It has a fan-like, basal fold, and is covered with dark leathery to woody tunics.

Leaves are few to several, and scattered along the stem or, in the stemless species, congested and often prostrate, ovate to linear-lanceolate, clasping below, parallel-veined, often with a distinct midrib; when broad, the leaves are arching. They have a soft leathery texture and the margins are sometimes crisped and smooth or ciliolate or bristly.

The inflorescence is single to few-flowered, bracteate and usually forming a congested raceme; the bracts are leaf-like or broader and often coloured or patterned, the inner bracts are successively smaller. The flowers are found at the base of the bract and are usually green-white. There are six tepals (rarely 7–12), which are not joined to form a tube. They have a swollen yellow nectary at the base. The six stamens are attached to the lower part of the tepals. The ovary is cylindrical; deeply lobed, has three free styles and many ovules per locule. The fruit is an ovoid capsule that spilts open along the edges of each chamber (septicidal). Most of the Cape species have curious, cupped tepal limbs, which hold the nectar, and often broad, colourful floral bracts that resemble large petals, which envelope the small flowers.","The name is derived from the Greek word, kolkhikon, referring to Colchis, an ancient region east of the Black Sea.","Few members of the genus are listed on the red data listed on the red data in Strelitzia 4 (Hilton-Taylor 1996). I believe the reason why only a few specimens have been collected is because of the flowering time which is during winter when there are few plant collecting activities.

These plants previously belonged to the genus Androcymbium but have since been included in Colchicum, which is the older name. DNA studies show that the species of Colchicum represent a single, specialised lineage or group that evolved from an ancestor within the genus Androcymbium. As such both genera must be included within one.

There are over 100 species found mostly in and around the Mediterranean on the Iberian Peninsula, North Africa and the Mediterranean climate zone of South Africa, 13 of which occur in the Western Cape. Most species occur in the western Karoo and Namaqualand, which lie to the north of the Cape Floral Region.

Species are found in sandy soil, most frequently near coastlines and also heavy clay soils inland. The location of the nectaries on the tepals does not favour the development of a floral tube; therefore various genera of the family Colchicaceae exploited a diversity of other unfamiliar pollinators such as small flies, wasps, beetles, butterflies and possibly rodents.

Southern African species of Colchicum are of limited horticultural appeal, but some species such as the Namaqualand C. capense subsp. ciliolatum and C. coloratum subsp. coloratum are a charming sight as the late afternoon light slants though their pale or reddish, sail-like bracts. Colchicum is long-lived, reaching at least 20–25 years of age in European species.",,"Being mostly plants of the winter rainfall region in the Mediterranean and in southern Africa, most require moisture during the winter months, but none in summer. Species from the summer rainfall region will require the reverse. They need a well-drained soil with more sand than humus as well as a warm spot in full sun with a dry resting period when they are dormant. Stop watering as soon as the foliage starts dying back at the end of the growing season.

In frost free areas with winter rainfall, a spot in the rock garden is a most suitable place to cultivate and display most of the species outdoors.

Plants can also be grown in deep containers in a well drained medium.

Colchicums can be propagated from fresh seed. The seed will ripen very quickly in hot, dry weather. Bryan (1989) advises planting immediately in well drained soil in pots, then separating to individual pots when large enough to handle and the following spring transplanting into the rockery.

It is more usual to plant the seed of winter growing geophytes in autumn (fall) at the commencement of the growing season, and to transplant the corms when dormant.

Plants will take about 4 years to flower if grown from seed. Plants can also be grown in pots without bottoms which are sunk into the rockery.

These plants can also be increased by separating the cormels or offsets from the corms. This can be done as soon as the foliage has died down in early midsummer or before growth commences.",,,"The bulb of Colchicum has been found to be toxic, yet it has been used medicinally by the Southern Sothos as ointment for the sore ears.

The leaves are twice compound, i.e. they consist of 5-11 feather-like pairs of pinnae; each pinna is further divided into 7-25 pairs of small, elliptic leaflets that can be bottle to bright green in colour. The leaf stalks are heavy. Very small glands, almost not noticeable with the naked eye, can be found at the base of most of the upper pinnae pairs.

It bears single to several, bright, golden yellow, globose, scented inflorescences between the leaves. The flower stalks are hairy. It flowers mainly from September-January, but it depends on the rainy season. The pods are very characteristic, resembling a beaded necklace. The pods are flat, straight or slightly curved, and fleshy when young with reddish hairs, becoming dark blackish when mature, deeply constricted between each seed and they do not split open, but break up transversely on the ground into single-seeded segments during March to September. The pods are sweetly scented when crushed and contain a sticky fluid.","This species was previously known as Acacia nilotica (L.) Willd. ex Delile subsp. kraussiana (Benth.) Brenan. Vachellia refers to George Harvey Vachell (1789 – 1839), chaplain to the British East India Company in Macoa, who collected plants in China: nilotica refers to it occurring along the Nile River, and kraussiana refers to Dr Christian Ferdinand Friedrich von Krauss (1812-1890), a German biologist and professor at the University of Stuttgart who travelled and collected in South Africa.","This tree occurs in a variety of woodland types, wooded grassland and scrub escarpment, forests and low-lying forest, in deep soil and along rivers. It is found in large areas of KwaZulu-Natal, Swaziland, eastern and northern Mpumalanga, the northern part of Gauteng, throughout Limpopo and the northeastern part of the North-West. This subspecies occurs south of the Zambezi River.",,"This medium to large semi-deciduous tree will grow in most gardens although slightly frost tender. It is very drought resistant.

It can easily be grown from seed. Please ensure that the seeds are cleaned properly. They can be slightly scarified or left in hot water for a few hours or overnight. For best results sow seed in separate bags as it develops a taproot very quickly. Seed normally germinates reasonably fast within 7-15 days. The trees are slow growing.",,,"The wood of this species is hard and reddish in colour and most of the browsers eat the leaves. It is used as firewood and for fencing posts. The bark exudes an edible gum and is used medicinally according to Van Wyk et al. (2000). The gum can also be used as glue. The Zulus take a decoction of the bark as a cough remedy. The Voortrekkers made ink and dyes from the pods (red, black and yellow). Other parts of the tree were used to treat eye diseases, or as a tranquillizer and even as an aphrodisiac. A root extract was used in the treatment of tuberculosis, impotence, diarrhoea, haemorrhages, toothache, dysentery and gonorrhoea. Extracts made from the leaves are used in the treatment of menstrual problems, eye infections, sores (specifically those caused by leprosy), ulcers, indigestion and haemorrhage.",,,,,
Phragmites australis,Phragmites australis,,"Phragmites australis is a robust, perennial reed up to 4 m high, with long rhizomes. Culm is solitary, not tillering. The leaf blade with a filiform apex, flexuous, 350 x 35 mm. Leaf sheaths remain on the culm after the leaves have fallen off. Inflorescence is compact, 120–400 mm long, with a ring of silky hairs at the base of lowest branches. The spikelet is 10–18 mm long; upper glume (the bracts at the base of the spikelet) 6–9 mm long and is acute; lemma (encloses grass flower) glabrous; callus hairs 6–10 mm long; anther 1.5–2.0 mm long. Flowering time: December to June.

According to the Wikipedia, Phragmites australis, can form stands as much as much as 1 square kilometre or more in extent where conditions are favourable. It can also spread at 5 metres or more per year by horizontal runners. As well as growing in damp ground, it can grow in standing water up to 1 metre or so deep, or even as a floating mat. It also tolerates brackish water and can grow near the sea in estuaries or salt marshes. It can be very invasive, but can be suppressed by grazing with livestock or repeated burning. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phragmites: consulted 12/01/2015)",Phragmites is derived from Greek word Phragma for a ‘hedge’ which means species whose stems are used for making hedges or fences (boundary). The genus Phragmites has ± 3 species; 2 species are found in southern Africa and they are widespread in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats.,"The SANBI Threatened Plants Programme has as yet not indicated its conservation status. Phragmites australis frequency in southern Africa is common or locally dominant.

Phragmites australis occurs throughout the world. The distribution is cosmopolitan. In South Africa it is widespread in aquatic and semi-aquatic areas. It is common especially in riverbeds and wet places in all vegetation types. It grows in all soil types, as long as there is adequate moisture. It can form dense stands particularly as a dominate species.",,Phragmites australis is not usually cultivated in gardens. It should be easy to grow in damp soil or wetlands and will grow fast if conditions suit it. Its growth should be carefully monitored to avoid it becoming invasive.,,,,,,,,
Mandela's Gold',Strelitzia reginae ,,"Mandela's Gold' is a stemless, evergreen clump-forming perennial. Greyish green, banana-like leaves grow to a height of about 1.5 m and during winter and spring the large bird-like flowers are held above the foliage on the tips of long, sturdy stalks. The structure and pollination of the flowers is fascinating. The hard, beak-like sheath from which the flower emerges, is called the spathe. This is held at right angles to the stem, and has the appearance of a bird's head.

Each spathe contains 4 to 6 flowers, and these emerge one at a time from the spathe. Each flower consists of 3 clear yellow sepals and 3 deep purple petals. The yellow sepals give the appearance of a crest on the 'bird's' head. Two of the purple petals are joined together around the stamens and the style to form an arrow-like structure. The third purple petal is visible as a small scale.

","At Kirstenbosch in the 1970s, there were seven yellow plants in the nursery. John Winter, who was curator during this period, began a project to increase the stock. It took nearly twenty years of careful selection and hand-pollination, and in 1994 the original stock had been built up enough to enable us to introduce the yellow strelitzia to horticulture. It was released and traded under the name 'Kirstenbosch Gold' until 1996 when the NBI was granted permission to re-name it in honour of Nelson Mandela.","Yellow-flowering strelitzias have been known for a number of years, plants have cropped up in France, California, Australia, Japan and in South Africa at a few locations in Eastern Cape and at Kirstenbosch and the Karoo Desert National Botanical Garden, but always as isolated specimens. Left to their own devices, the seeds from these yellow forms will not breed true as they will most likely have been pollinated by an orange plant. To get yellow progeny, two yellow plants must be crossed.Nectar is produced by a gland at the base of the flower. In fact, so much nectar is produced that it leaks out and drips down the side of the spathe. Although it is not certain exactly which bird is the pollinator, when it comes to feed on the nectar, it perches on the arrow-like purple petals, which open to expose the anthers and the sticky pollen adheres to the feet of the bird. The bird then transfers this pollen to the stigma of the next flower it visits.",,"Strelitzia reginae 'Mandela's Gold' is an easy plant to grow and will thrive in most soils.

Ideal conditions are full sun, rich, well-drained loam soil with a pH of approximately 7.5, regular deep watering in summer and liberal applications of fertilizer in early summer. Bonemeal and plenty of mature compost should be mixed into the soil when planting. Plants will respond well to generous applications of manure and compost or additional fertilizer watered in about once a month during summer. A fertilizer with the proportions 3:1:5 encourages flowering, and can be alternated with other formulations.

In South Africa and other sunny countries, strelitzias will also do well in semi-shade, but in less sunny regions, they need as much sun as they can get if they are to flower well. Once established, they can survive with very little water, and they are tolerant of wind and coastal conditions. But 'Mandela's Gold' is sensitive to cold and needs a sheltered position against a north- or west-facing wall in areas that experience frost, and is not suitable for permanent outdoor cultivation in regions that experience a winter low of -7 to -1 ÂºC / 30 to 40 ÂºF (zone 9) or lower.

Clump in flower

'Mandela's Gold' is a striking feature plant, a decorative garden subject and adds a tropical feel to courtyards and swimming pool areas. It is also an excellent cutflower. It is suitable for cultivation in large tubs and containers but for better flowering performance it should then be fed with a dilute liquid fertilizer at least every second week, particularly at the beginning of the growing season. In cold climates it can be grown in a sunny or brightly-lit conservatory.

Propagation is by seed or division. The plants are slow-growing and large clumps that are split or moved will take at least two years to re-establish themselves and flower again. To get a mature flowering plant from seed: under ideal conditions it takes about 3 years; but under less than ideal conditions it can take from 5 to 7 years. For best results sow fresh seed in spring or early summer. To improve germination, the seed can be soaked in a solution of ethrel, but this treatment is not necessary for germination to occur. Without ethrel treatment approx. 50% of the seed should germinate in 4 to 8 weeks with a further 30% germinating sporadically for up to one year after sowing. With ethrel treatment, 80% of the seeds should germinate within the first 4 to 8 weeks.

Before sowing, remove the bright orange aril and soak the seed in a solution of ethrel at a concentration of 2000 ppm active constituent, for 48 hours. Sow in seedtrays filled with a well-drained soil medium at a depth of 1 to 1½ times the size of the seed. A constant temperature of 25C is most suitable for germination as low temperatures retard germination. Seedlings should be a good size before being transplanted (two to three leaves) into a well-drained potting medium. In our nursery we have found that the young plants are best grown in semi-shade, as the leaves tend to burn in direct sunlight. Regular repotting allows the young plant to develop rapidly. Restricting the root development retards growth.",,,,,,,,
Welwitschia mirabilis,Welwitschia mirabilis,,"An adult welwitschia consists of two leaves, a stem base and roots.That is all! Its two permanent leaves are unique in the plant kingdom.They are the original leaves from when the plant was a seedling, and they just continue to grow and are never shed. They are leathery, broad, strap-shaped and they lie on the ground becoming torn to ribbons and tattered with age. The stem is low, woody, hollowed-out, obconical in shape and sturdy. It grows to about 500 mm in height. The largest recorded specimen is in the Messum Mountains and is 1.8 m high, and another on the Welwitschia Flats near the Swakop River is 1.2 m tall and 8.7 m wide. Carbon dating tells us that on average, welwitschias are 500-600 years old, although some of the larger specimens are thought to be 2000 years old. Their estimated lifespan is 400 to 1500 years. Growth occurs annually during the summer months.

The sexes are separate, i.e. there are male plants and female plants. The male cones are salmon-coloured, small, oblong cone-like structures, and the female cones are blue-green, larger and more tapering. At Kirstenbosch, they flower from mid summer to autumn. The male flowerhas a sterile, modified pistil-like structure, which exudes nectar (50% sugar content) from a modified stigma-like structure. The female cone has exposed stigmas and also produces a nectar droplet.

Cone-bearing plants are often wind pollinated, producing masses of pollen and all at the same time. Welwitschia is clearly not wind pollinated, as it produces smaller amounts of pollen, with the nectar to attract insects, and the flowers open in succession over an extended period, which also encourages cross-pollination. It may be a beetle, but judging by the fact that large distances can separate plants, Ernst van Jaarsveld thinks it is more likely to be a kind of wasp, which he has seen on the male cones in habitat. The female cones reach maturity in the spring, about 9 months after fertilization.

The seeds are 36 x 25 mm and have a large papery wing and are dispersed by wind, in spring, when the female cone disintegrates.In their natural habitat, many seeds are lost to fungal infection and to small desert animals that feed on them. The seeds remain viable for a number of years. They germinate only if fairly heavy rain is spread over a period of several days. As these conditions rarely occur, it often happens that many plants in some colonies are the same age, as they all germinated in the same good year. The seedlings, once established, depend on the fog for survival until the next rains occur.

There are more remarkable features that make Welwitschia so difficult to categorise: Unlike any other plant, the apical growth point of the stem stops growing from an early stage. This causes the stem to grow upwards and outwards, away from the original apex (which remains dead), resulting in the characteristic obconical shape. In older specimens, continued growth results in the undulating of the stem margin. This growth habit is unique. Like other cone-bearing plants (gymnosperms e.g. pines and cycads) it is a dioecious (male and female separate) cone-bearer with naked seeds, but the male 'flowers' or microstroboli are reminiscent of the flowering plants (angiosperms). The water-conducting tissue (xylem) is also typical of the angiosperms.","Welwitschia mirabilis was discovered by the Austrian botanist,explorer and medical doctor, Friedrich Welwitsch, in 1859 in the Namib Desert of southern Angola. The story goes that he was so overcome by his find that he knelt down next to it and simply stared! ThomasBaines, the renowned artist and traveller, also found a plant in the dry bed of the Swakop River in Namibia in 1861. Welwitsch sent the first material of Welwitschia to Sir Joseph Dalton Hooker, Director of Kew, in 1862. Hooker described it and named it in honourof Welwitsch, despite the fact that Welwitsch recommended that it be named Tumboa, its native Angolan name. Its species name mirabilis means marvellous or wonderful in Latin. The specific name was later changed to bainesii to honour both men involved in its discovery, but by the rules of botanical nomenclature, mirabilis is the current and valid name.","Welwitschia has not been assessed by the IUCN Red List. It is still common in its habitat and shows variability, which is a sign that it is far from extinction. They are neither endangered nor rare, nevertheless they are protected by law.

Welwitschia mirabilis grows in isolated communities in the Namib Desert, in a narrow strip, about 1 000 km along up the coast from the Kuiseb River in central Namibia to Mossamedes in southern Angola. The plants are seldom found more than 100 to 150 km from the coast, and their distribution coincides with the fog belt. Because it is so different from other gymnosperms, Welwitschia was placed in its own family in a small order of gymnosperms called the Gnetales. It shares this order with two other families each containing one genus: the Gnetaceae (Gnetum, 30 species) and the Ephedraceae (Ephedra, 40 species). All three genera can stand by themselves, and the relationships between them are remote. There is nothing else like them, and of the three, Welwitschiais the most remote.

Welwitschia is thought to be a relic from the Jurassic period when gymnosperms dominated the world's flora, its ancestor trapped in an environment that slowly but progressively became more arid, and all its close relatives long since disappeared.

Welwitschia is ecologically highly specialized, and is adapted to grow under arid conditions receiving regular fog. This regular, dense fog is formed when the cold north-flowing Benguela Current meets the hot air coming off the Namib Desert. The fog develops during the night and usually subsides by about 10 a.m The leaves are broad and large and droop downwards. This is an ideal way for it to water its own roots from water collected by condensation. It also has numerous stomata on both leaf surfaces and it was thought that fog-water was taken up directly through these stomata but this has been shown not to be true. The fog has been estimated to contribute 50 mm in annual rainfall, but in spite of the fog, the plants are still dependent on additional sources. Rainfall in this area is erratic and extremely low, only 10 - 100 mm during the summer months. In some years, no rain falls at all. The plants are often confined to dry watercourses or next to higher rainfall regions, and they occasionally grow on rocky outcrops. All these habitats point to an additional underground water supply. The plant has a long taproot, allowing it to reach this underground water.

There are other interesting environmental adaptations. The largest plants are found to the south where the rainfall is the least, whereas in the north where the rainfall is higher the plants are much smaller. The most likely reason for this is that the plants in the north have to compete with savannah vegetation whereas those in the south have little or no competition. Another interesting adaptation is the corky bark, which could be the result of thousands of years of exposure to grass fires so commonly associated with savannah.",,"At first glance it would appear that Welwitschia would be almost impossible to grow, but this is only partly true. Welwitschias can be grown easily, even as pot plants and even on window sills and verandahs in cooler climates. Once established, the plant will grow steadily and is relatively disease free. The most crucial stage is during its first eight months after germination when it is prone to fungal attack. Also, as it is not a true succulent, it should not be treated as one. It is dependant on additional water from its roots and if grown in a pot, care should be taken that the soil does not dry out completely.

When growing welwitschia there are a few important factors to take into consideration: the long taproot, its dependence on extra moisture and the soil used. Plants from arid regions are often lost to fungal infection caused by soil with a high organic content. It is safer to use a sandy mixture, water more frequently and give supplementary feedings. It is also recommended to use sterilized soil. Older plants tend to accumulate organic debris around themselves which enriches the soil and acts as a mulch, helping to retain water in the upperlayers of the sand for longer.

Seed should be sown during the warmer months, spring or summer. In habitat the seeds are dispersed in spring, but have to wait for rain to fall before they germinate. It is best to sow seed into a large, deep (at least 300 mm, preferably more) container or into an open bed where the plant is intended to remain, because the taproot grows quite fast in the initial stages. If using a container, remember to place a layer of gravel or rocks at the bottom to ensure good drainage. The soil must be sandy and well-drained, e.g. 2 parts sand : 1 part loam : 1 part compost (leaf mould) with ample bonemeal, well mixed and sterilized. Moisten the soil thoroughly before sowing. If using a container, sow two or three seeds per container, near the centre. If more than one germinates, it can be transplanted in its first month, or left to form interesting graft complexes with its sibling. If you have an open bed, scatter them evenly over the surface. Place the seed on top of the soil and just cover it with a layer of sand. Water well and keep in a warm sunny situation. It is important to add a mild fungicide, like Captan, to the water during the first year as it will prevent fungal attack. Keep the soil moist until the seeds have germinated. Germination takes 1 to 3 weeks.

The placement of the ungerminated and germinating seedlings is also important. Choose a well-aerated, warm atmosphere, preferably in filtered sunlight. The plants are very sensitive to sudden changes in light intensity. Never move a plant from a shady situation to full sun, the leaves will burn and the plant may never recover and die. So when moving your plant, make sure that you gradually harden it off to brighter light. Welwitschias in containers can be grown in glasshouses, window sills, verandahs or outdoors in areas with rainfall of below 500 mm per annum. In higher rainfall areas, it may be quite happy on a slope. Also, we do not know its frost tolerance. Just because its habitat is frost-free today, does not mean that it did not have to contend with a colder climate during its evolutionary history.

Germination should occur from 7 days to a few months after sowing.The first sign is the cracking of the soil and the appearance ofthe two cotyledons, initially pink in colour, becoming green. Initial growth is very rapid, particularly the growth of the taproot. It is essential that seedlings in a shallow tray be planted out as soon as the cotyledons appear. Take care when transplanting, if the root tip is damaged or broken, the seedling will die. Keep the seedlings well watered during the first season. The warmer the temperature, the faster they will grow. At Kirstenbosch, the temperature in the Welwitschia House varies between 20 and 40 degrees C in summer and growth is good, 20-30 mm high in three weeks with a taproot 50-70 mm long. It is better to give too much water than too little, but remember the fungicide.

Seedlings should be watered regularly, at least once a week at first, and later watering can be reduced to once every two weeks.The amount of water also depends on the climate, cooler climates requiring less watering than hot dry ones. During the natural resting period in winter, watering should be reduced, and increased in late spring when the weather warms up again.

Welwitschia reacts well to being fed, and 'green up' and grow a bit more rapidly in response to a mild, natural, organic seaweed-based fertilizer added to the water once every three months during the summer. The Kirstenbosch plants also get a dose of inorganic 2:3:4 in the spring.

The cotyledons may last for up to two years in cultivation. They become erect and expand to a length of 27-35 mm and the permanent leaves will then become visible between them. They are always opposite to the cotyledons and it is these two leaves that the plant retains for life. The permanent leaves grow rapidly, soon overtaking the cotyledons. They are upright at first, becoming erectly spreading after 8-12 weeks and eventually diverging. Between the two leaves another pair of what appear to be leaves will appear. These are the cotyledonary buds, also situated opposite the cotyledons. They gradually become swollen and keeled and from here onwards, the peculiar growth habit begins. These cotyledonary buds are in fact axillary buds whose apical growth stops, causing the death of the growing tip. Now, instead of apical growth the buds gradually broaden, eventually merging. The meristematic tissue at the base of the buds now grows sideways, together with the meristematic tissue on the outer sides of the leaf, which causes the leaf groove to deepen and causes the characteristic obconical growth of the stem apex. This growth occurs annually during the warmer months and is visible in concentric rings.Thus age can be roughly estimated by counting these rings, analogous to the growth rings of a tree.

Welwitschia is relatively disease-free, except during its first year or so when it should be watered with a fungicide. They are prone to attack by woolly aphid, but this can be controlled with an insecticide like Malasol. Caterpillars have also been caught on the leaves of the Kirstenbosch plants.",,,,,,,,
Widdringtonia cedarbergensis,Widdringtonia cedarbergensis,,"Young trees have conical crowns, and old trees have massive gnarled trunks and spreading branches. The bark is reddish grey, thin and fibrous, flaking in scale-like plates.

Juvenile leaves are narrow and needle-like, 20 x 2 mm, and are spirally arranged. Adult leaves are small, scale-like, up to 4 mm long, and lie flat along the branches in pairs. Both forms are sometimes present on a young tree.

Male and female cones are borne on the same plant. Male cones are very small, up to 2 mm long, and are produced in autumn. Female cones are dark brown, almost spherical, up to 25 mm in diameter, with 4 woody, rough, warty scales. They develop in autumn, and remain on the tree for almost 3 years before the seeds are released during late summer. As a result, they can be found on the tree all year round in various stages of development. Seeds are black-brown, ovoid, with a narrow wing.","The genus Widdringtonia was named after Edward Widdrington, a Royal Navy captain and a conifer botanist of the late 1700s and early 1800s, who published a book on European pines. The species name cedarbergensis means 'of the Cederberg'.","Widdringtonia cedarbergensis is critically endangered.

The Clanwilliam cedar is confined to an area of approximately 250 km² in the Cederberg Mountains, about 240 km north of Cape Town. It occurs singly or in scattered groups on rocky outcrops and mountaintops at altitudes from 800 to 1 980 m. In former times the whole mountain chain was studded with these trees, but by 1883 nearly all accessible trees of commercial value had been felled. The Clanwilliam cedars today are usually 5-7 m tall but, in protected inaccessible places, specimens of up to 20 m with trunks of up to 2 m in diameter can be found, although many of them were destroyed in the fire of 1989. But even these large specimens are dwarfs compared to the past giants which must have been at least double the girth of any of those now standing. There is a report of a tree cut down in 1836 having a girth of 36 feet (11 m).There are three species of Widdringtonia, namely W. nodiflora (= W. cupressoides and W. dracomontana), the mountain cedar, W. schwarzii, the Willowmore cedar, and W. cedarbergensis (= W. juniperoides). They are easy to tell apart in the wild as they are geographically separated: W. schwarzii is restricted to Baviaanskloof and the Kouga Mountains in the Willowmore District which is 560 km west of the Cederberg, and W. nodiflora occurs from Table Mountain in Western Cape eastwards and northwards through Eastern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal and Mpumalanga to Limpopo [Northern Province] and further northwards into tropical Africa. They are not so easy to identify in the Garden, but it is possible: W. nodiflora female cones are smooth, wrinkled or slightly warty, whereas the other two are conspicuously rough and warty. W. schwarzii seed has a conspicuous wing, whereas that of W. cedarbergensis is smaller. W. nodiflora is a variable species that extends into tropical Africa. The Mlanje cedar of Malawi, W. whytei, is considered to be a variant of W. nodiflora.

Widdringtonias are members of the cypress family, which is very poorly represented in South Africa. This is the only genus out of 16 in the whole family that occurs in South Africa. Its fragmented distribution has given rise to the theory that they are the last remnants of a vegetation that once, in some remote period, covered a far larger and more connected area. Fossil wood has been found near Knysna.",,"The wood of Widdringtonia cedarbergensis is beautiful, light yellow to whitish, resinous and fragrant, and exceedingly durable. It works well, takes a fine polish and is borer-proof. The pews, doors and carved altar in the Anglican Church in Clanwilliam, as well as the furnishings in the Courthouse, are all made of Clanwilliam cedar. It was also popular for shipbuilding, it was used for almost all the woodwork needed by the early settlers in the Clanwilliam area, and makes splendid furniture. It was once sold by the wagonload for fence poles, and it has been claimed that the cedar posts had not decayed by more than the thickness of a sheet of paper after 30 years in the ground, and were still immovable 100 years later. In 1879 the telegraph line between Piketberg and Calvinia, 289 km apart, was laid on more than 7000 cedar poles.

A clear, hard gum yielded by the cones and branches was once used medicinally in the form of fumigations in the treatment of gout, rheumatism and oedematous swellings. It was also used for making plasters, and as a varnish.",,,"The Clanwilliam cedar is propagated from seed sown in autumn, in well-drained, sandy soil. Germination takes 3-4 weeks and seedlings can be transplanted as soon as they are large enough to handle. The seed germinates relatively well, and will benefit from treatment with Instant Smoke Plus Seed Primer. Initial growth is good, and saplings are best grown on in semi-shade. The Clanwilliam cedar is susceptible to the root fungus Phytophthora cinnamomi, so sterile soil should be used, and root disturbance kept to a minimum. Also, do not allow the saplings to dry out. Adult trees may be drought-tolerant but young trees in containers will not survive a total drought.

Established trees are drought-tolerant, and are frost hardy in South Africa but are probably not hardy to prolonged cold at temperatures below -5 °C/20 °F. The Clanwilliam cedar is an ornamental conifer suitable for most gardens. It is also a good choice for the fynbos garden, and is an interesting bonsai subject. It makes a good indigenous Christmas tree subject in a large tub or half-barrel.

Because they are resinous and burst into flame relatively easily, this is not a good tree to plant near the house if you live in a fire-prone area, or to plant near your braai (barbecue) area.",,,,,
Zantedeschia odorata,Zantedeschia odorata,,"This winter-growing, summer-dormant geophyte grows 0.75 – 1 m high and has a deep-seated rootstock known as a stem tuber. Its 5 or 6, broadly arrow-shaped, plain green leaves have undulate margins and are carried on prominent petioles (leaf stalks). The erect flower stem produces a white spathe (a large sheathing bract) which encloses a yellowish orange spadix, a finger-like organ along which the minute, unisexual individual flowers occur. The female flowers occupy the lower part of the spadix and the male flowers appear above them. Flowering takes place from late July to August and a moderately sweet scent is emitted.

The fruit is a berry with a pulpy outer covering which dries up when ripe, revealing several round, hard, light brown seeds.","In 1826 the German botanist Kurt Sprengel (1766 – 1833) named the genus Zantedeschia in honour of the Italian physician and botanist Giovanni Zantedeschi (1773 – 1846), who published works on the flora of the province of Brescia in the Lombardy region of northern Italy. The first species to be described under this genus was Z. aethiopica, the common white arum lily, although it had earlier been known as Calla aethiopica when Linnaeus described it in 1753. It has been in cultivation in Europe since the 1660s and is one of the world's most familiar plants, having become widely naturalized in temperate and tropical parts. Using several summer-growing species, including the dwarf pink or white Z. rehmannii, the white Z. albomaculata and the yellow Z. pentlandii, an extensive range of Zantedeschia hybrids have been raised in New Zealand and California for cut flowers and bedding plants, as well as numerous brightly coloured dwarf cultivars for pot plant production.","The spathe of Zantedeschia odorata looks very similar to that of Z. aethiopica but differs in being narrower, and the spadix is much shorter. Z. odorata is also distinguished from Z. aethiopica by its different, sweet scent, and its flower stems bending over towards the end of the fruiting period, whereas those of Z. aethiopica remain more or less erect. Z. odorata has a very restricted distribution, see below, whereas Z. aethiopica is widespread throughout most of South Africa.The conservation status of Zantedeschia odorata is Rare, which means that it is not exposed to any known direct or plausible potential threat and does not qualify for a category of threat according to the criteria determined by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The plants are not currently threatened because of the protection they enjoy from the surrounding boulders amongst which they grow.

Zantedeschia odorata is endemic to a small area of the Bokkeveld Escarpment near Nieuwoudtville in the Northern Cape, occurring in Nieuwoudtville-Roggeveld Dolerite Renosterveld vegetation . The plants grow in small groups and are confined to dolerite outcrops where water collects in depressions amongst boulders in doleritic clay. The red-flowered Sparaxis pillansii (family Iridaceae) is one of many geophytic companion species endemic to dolerite outcrops where Z. odorata occurs. The genus Zantedeschia has eight species ( Z. aethiopica, Z. albomaculata, Z. elliottiana, Z. jucunda, Z. odorata, Z. pentlandii, Z. rehmannii and Z. valida ) and its centre of diversity is in eastern Mpumalanga. These mainly spring- and summer-flowering plants are almost entirely confined to southern Africa, with the exception of Z. albomaculata subsp. albomaculata whose range extends as far north as Tanzania in East Africa.",,"Propagation is best from seed as the plants do not readily form offsets. Sow seeds 5 mm deep in deep seed trays in autumn in a well-drained medium such as equal parts coarse river sand and finely milled bark or potting compost. Keep the sowing medium moist by watering with a fine rose, and fresh seeds will germinate within two to three weeks. At the beginning of their second autumn, pot them up into plastic nursery bags or pots and allow them to grow on for one year. At the beginning of their third autumn, place them in permanent containers, raised beds or deep containers. Flowers can be expected in the third year, if grown well.

The rootstocks require protection from porcupines, especially during the active growth and flowering periods.",,,"However, the cooked leaves of Z. aethiopica are used as a pot herb by some African and Indian communities in South Africa.","In their fresh state, all Zantedeschia species are poisonous due to the presence of calcium oxalate, a compound that forms crystals known as raphides",,,,
Gazania krebsiana,Gazania krebsiana,,"Gazania krebsiana is an extremely showy plant when in flower, largely due to its warm and bright flower colour, its flower size, and its extended flowering period. The plants are semi-decumbent (prostrate to ascending), perennial and herbaceous, and reach a height of approximately 150 mm. They are therefore aptly referred to as tufted groundcovers, and many individuals together may give a rather mat-like appearance, a sight that is very beautiful when in bloom. Individually they form rounded tufts on the ground of about 200 mm across with very distinctive foliage. The root system of G. krebsiana is fairly weak and consists of a series of adventitious roots. There is no definite main or taproot meaning the adventitious roots are quite shallow, only about 250 mm deep. This is one of the reasons why these plants react so well to rain and are therefore regarded as excellent pioneer plants.

The leaves may vary in shape especially when young. Mature leaves are usually compound and divided into small, narrow, regular lobes of about 4-6 on each side. They are rough to the touch, dark shiny green on the upper side and woolly white underneath. The main vein is brownish and prominent on the underside. The leaf, including the petiole (leafstalk), can reach a length of 170 mm. Leaves are closely spaced on the short shoots. A distinctive characteristic of Gazania is that the flowering stalks contain a milky sap.

Flowerheads measure 50-60(-90) mm in diameter. The upper side of the ray florets (the florets at the margin of a flowerhead in the Asteraceae) is mainly a magnificent dark red or orange, with dark brown markings on the lower quarter. In some literature the flower colour is referred to as terracotta, hence the common name terracotta gazania. The dark brown markings may contain black or white spots, adding more eloquence to the flowers. Gazania krebsiana flowers from August till January, reaching a peak in October and November.

Each flowerhead contains about 25 fruits, ± 5 x 1 mm. Each fruit is equipped with silky hairs that enable it to be easily dispersed by the wind. The seeds start maturing from October, and ants may be seen carrying them away into their underground tunnels.","The genus name Gazania was given in honour of Theodor of Gaza (1938-1948). He was responsible for the translation of the botanical works of Theophrastus from Greek into Latin. Another possibility is that gaza (Greek for riches) could refer to the richness in colour, variety and abundance of the plant. The Afrikaans common name botterblom (butter flower) owes its name to the fact that the ray florets are supposed to taste like butter when chewed. The English common name, terracotta gazania, refers to the terracotta colour of the flowers.","Due to its adaptability and the abundance of seeds it produces, Gazania krebsiana is well established in all habitats across its distribution range. Seeds are able to travel across large distances and can remain viable for a number of years. The plants are relatively short-lived, up to about three years depending on various conditions. Currently there is no concern that these plants might become rare or endangered. However, it must be mentioned that many major populations in certain parts of Namaqualand have become heavily reduced, largely due to overgrazing from domestic livestock.

Gazania krebsiana has a very wide distribution range, mainly within the winter rainfall region of South Africa. It is found in virtually all provinces of South Africa from Namaqualand in the west to the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal in the east. Northward it extends into the drier interior of the Great Karoo, the Free State and then into some parts of the summer rainfall regions of Gauteng and the Lowveld. Plants are adaptable and flourish in a host of habitats but are mostly found along roadsides, on flats or lower slopes, exposed hills and rocky outcrops and stony ridges. The latter two habitats are especially ideal in the Namaqualand region of the country. To a lesser extent they may well be found in grassy situations, in montane vegetation, and in coastal dune vegetation which is commonly referred to as Strandveld (seaside plants) in the west to south, and thicket in the east. Associated vegetation types include Succulent Karoo, Nama Karoo, Fynbos, Dry Valley Bushveld and Grasslands. Plants seem to tolerate a number of soil types but have a noticeable preference for clay and sandy soil.",,"All Gazania species and cultivars are easy to establish by mixing the hairy fruits with sand to obtain a better distribution and planting them directly in loosened soil. After sowing, the soil must be irrigated immediately to ensure that the seeds come in close contact with the soil for germination purposes. The seeds germinate after 4-6 days. Alternatively, sow fruits first into a sandy medium and cover slightly with sand to a depth of 2 mm. Water daily using a fine water spray and keep in a sheltered environment. As soon as the seedlings are strong enough, they may be planted in the garden. The seeds are sown in April.",,,,,,,,
Satyrium princeps,Satyrium princeps,,"The rootstock of this deciduous, winter-growing geophyte is a root-stem tuberoid, a storage organ which consists of both root and stem tissue. The plant reaches up to 86 cm high in flower and has two broadly oval leaves which are prostrate and fleshy. The upper leaf surface has a thick transparent, water-storing epidermis.

The sturdy brownish maroon flower stem has 7-9 prominent dry, membranous sheaths, and the dense, erect spike consists of deep carmine-red, unscented or sometimes faintly sweet-scented flowers. Flowering takes place from September to November, with a peak in October.

At the beginning of the growing season in late autumn, a new shoot develops from the apex of the tuberoid, which forms the regenerative bud. As the shoot develops, adventitious roots grow from the base of the stem where it is attached to the tuberoid, and at the same time, a replacement tuberoid also develops there, resulting in the plant having two tuberoids during its active growth phase: the old one that formed during the previous winter season, which gradually withers, and the new one that develops during the current winter season and sprouts anew the following autumn.

Satyrium flowers are non-resupinate, meaning that the hood-like labellum (lip) is the uppermost floral segment, while the sepals and petals face downwards.","The genus Satyrium was first described by the Swedish taxonomist, Olof Peter Swartz, in 1800. The name Satyrium is probably derived from the Greek/Roman mythological satyr, a half-man half-goat with two budding horns, and alludes to the flower's two-spurred lip, characteristic of most satyrium species. The goat-like smell of the flowers of certain species is an alternative theory. The Latin specific epithet princeps refers to the 'princely' or 'most distinguished' appearance of the inflorescence.

S. princeps was described in 1888 by the English orchidologist, Harry Bolus, in volume 18 of the third series of Hooker's Icones Plantarum, accompanied by an illustration by the British botanical artist Matilda Smith. (Bolus was a businessman who spent most of his life in South Africa and studied orchids as a hobby.)","Satyrium princeps is a protected species. It is also a threatened species as much of its former habitat has been lost to coastal housing development, agricultural expansion and infestation by alien plants, especially Australian acacias. Its current conservation status is categorized as Vulnerable.

Satyrium princeps is known from only a few sites in the region extending from Wilderness in the southern Cape to Port Alfred in the Eastern Cape. It occurs in full sun on fixed littoral dunes in small to large colonies and is locally plentiful in deep sand among low scrub or grasses, from sea level to 150 m. It occurs in Southern Cape Dune Fynbos, Algoa Dune Strandveld and Albany Dune Strandveld vegetation types.",,"Several winter-growing satyriums, including S. princeps, are outstanding subjects for display in containers and they are generally of much easier culture than the summer-growing species. The latter, especially those of marsh and wetland habitats, are probably greatly dependent on association with mycorrhizal fungi and soil specificity, and are usually short-lived in cultivation. S. princeps performs very well in the bulb nursery at Kirstenbosch in deep, 20-25 cm diam. plastic pots. With careful attention to growing medium, watering procedure and maintenance of a summer dormant period, this species is generally long-lived, sometimes lasting up to 20 years.

It needs full sun or bright light to flower well, and a stake is best inserted at planting time (so as not to damage the delicate tuberoid during the growth phase) to prevent stems from falling over in strong wind. Plant the tuberoids with their tops 10-20 mm below the soil surface, in a very sandy, acid growing medium such as six parts of washed silica sand and one part of finely milled, composted bark, with a 20-30 mm layer of well-rotted compost placed at the base of the container over the drainage chips. Exercise care when handling the tuberoids as they are easily bruised, and should not be stored in open air as they rapidly desiccate and perish. Should it become necessary to transplant actively growing specimens, take great care, as the tuberoids easily become detached from the base of the stem.

Watering procedure is of critical importance. Start with an initial drench in late autumn, then wait until the new shoots appear, followed by a drench about once every 10 days, allowing the medium to dry out somewhat before the next drench is applied. The plants respond well to liquid fertilizer applications with high potassium but low nitrogen content. Since the plants flower in late spring and early summer, it is necessary to continue watering for as long as possible in order to maintain pleasing green leaves while the plants are in flower, failing which, the leaves may turn yellow. After flowering or as soon as the leaves start to desiccate, cease all watering and maintain a completely dry summer rest period.

Adult tuberoids usually form a single replacement tuberoid but sometimes two or three are produced and these can be separated and replanted immediately into dry soil in late summer, before active growth begins. Unfortunately the seeds of S. princeps cannot be stored for long periods because they contain very small food reserves, and can only be raised when sown in sterile laboratory conditions in special growth media.

The tuberoids are subject to fungal rot if not grown in well drained soil and kept dry in summer",,,,,,,,
Podalyria buxifolia,Podalyria buxifolia,,"Podalyria buxifolia is a spreading, well-branched, resprouting shrub growing to 1m high with a 2m spread. The leaves are simple, alternate, elliptic-oblong, 30mm long and up to 10mm wide with a pronounced midvein. They are dark, glossy-green on top and have silky white hairs on the lower surfaces that produce a silvery sheen. The stems are thin and wiry and yellowish green.

The attractive, magenta, and strongly fragrant flowers are held on long petioles arising from the axils of leaves near the branch ends. Flowering time is from August to April.

The flowers are followed by narrowly-inflated, hairy, green pods maturing to brown, approximately 40×15 mm. The pods dry to a crisp and split during hot weather to release several small seeds with fleshy, collar-like arils.","The genus Podalyria was named by Lamarck after Podalirius / Podalyrius (Latin) from Podaleirios (Greek), the son of Asklepios, god of healing. According to the Iliad, Podaleirios and his brother Machaon were physicians to the Greek army during the Trojan Wars. The specific name buxifolia refers to its leaves being similar to the evergreen shrub genus Buxus, with the Latin folium meaning 'leaf'.","Podalyria buxifolia is a fynbos plant and occurs in the winter-rainfall Western and Eastern Cape from the western Outeniqua to the Kareedouw Mountains. It is found on sandstone slopes in kloofs (ravines), on moist hillsides, and on forest margins of 200-1000 m. Generally they do not grow in frost zones, however, mature plants may well survive frost as they can resprout. Young plants will therefore have to be protected. Plants will grow in temperatures between 5 and 35 degrees Celsius and require average to good winter rainfall, probably between 500 and 1000 mm per annum. Podalyria belongs in the tribe Podalyrieae, subfamily Papilionoideae, family Fabaceae. Its closest relatives are the genera Virgilia, Cyclopia and Stirtonanthus.

Podalyria is a genus of 25 species, endemic to southern Africa. Most podalyrias occur in the winter rainfall region of South Africa, but some extend into the Eastern Cape and a few into the Northern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal. The best known species in the group is Podalyria calyptrata.

Podalyria buxifolia grows on hills and mountain slopes on poor, acidic, quartzitic soils. It is a resprouter with a persistent underground stem from which new shoots grow vigorously after fire or cutting. It also produces seeds which are expelled from dry pods. Seeds may be shot up to a metre away. Thereafter seeds are taken underground by ants which utilise the nutrient-rich aril. Seeds remain in the ground until the vegetation is removed by fire. The heat encourages the seeds to germinate.

Podalyria buxifolia flowers are very attractive to many insects, particularly carpenter bees, and nectar-feeders like honeybees, butterflies and hoverflies.",,"Podalyria buxifolia has lovely flowers and it can be used for its horticultural potential.

Podalyria buxifolia is easily grown from seeds. Collect seed pods when they are dark brown, dry and beginning to split open. Place in a paper packet and put in a warm, dry place such as a windowsill where the pods can explode. The packet will prevent the expelled seeds from being lost. Store seeds in a bottle and drop some insecticide dust into the it before closing the lid. This will prevent predators from eating all the seeds.

Sow seeds in late summer or autumn, although they will probably germinate at any time of the year. First soak the seeds in hot water of about 80 degrees Celsius until the water has cooled. Sow the seeds into a well-drained, acidic, potting mix in trays, plugs or individual pots, and cover lightly. Place containers in a well-ventilated, warm, sunny position where the seeds are protected from rain. Sowing directly into plugs or pots minimizes root disturbance and maximizes the number of surviving seedlings. Do not over-water and allow the medium to dry out a little between waterings. The seeds germinate very quickly within three weeks.

Podalyrias, like most legumes, are very susceptible to pre-emergence damping off and treating the seeds with a fungicide to combat this will improve the percentage of surviving seedlings. These fungicides are available at your local nursery. The seedlings should be potted into small pots at cotyledon stage before the first pair of true leaves develop. The potting mix should be well drained. A mixture of equal parts well-rotted pine bark or compost and coarse river sand is recommended. The small plants should be fed every week or second week with an organic liquid fertiliser. The seedlings will establish relatively quickly and should be ready to be planted into the garden in 12 months.

Podalyrias generally do not root easily from cuttings, and the plants are never as strong as seed-grown plants. Podalyria buxifolia appears not to root from tip or heel cuttings taken from the main branches. However, this species roots well if heel cuttings are taken from the underground rootstock, otherwise known as rootstock cuttings. Rootstock cuttings can only be taken from mature plants that have developed an underground rootstock from which new shoots emerge. This is only possible when the plant is resprouting after fire or after being cut to the ground. Cuttings can only be taken from wild plants if you are in possession of a collecting permit and have landowner permission.

Podalyria buxifolia is a lovely spreading, openly branched shrub. It is perhaps best planted mixed with other medium-sized fynbos plants. More time will be needed to experiment to see what manicuring is needed to bring out the best in this species. It is likely that a mature plant should be pruned hard to the ground every few years to encourage it to resprout; this should also encourage flowering. To achieve a more compact, bushy specimen, plant it in full sun and pinch back young growth.",,,,,,,,
Serruria furcellata,Serruria furcellata,sweet scented,"Serruria furcellata is a multi-stemmed, resprouting, erect shrub reaching a height of 0.5 m and spanning 1 m across. The dissected leaves, which are distinctive of this species, are hairless and bright green. The plant produces a solitary, sweet-scented, pink flowerhead and flowers in spring to early summer (from August to October). The seeds are released within two months of flowering.","The genus was named after J. Serrurier, a professor of botany at the University of Utrecht in the early eighteenth century. The species name furcellata means small fork, and refers to the distinctively forked leaves. The common name derives from the area it originally existed, Kraaifontein. Urbanization is threatening other members of this genus, including Serruria cyanoides and Serruria aemula.","The plant is listed as Endangered in the Red Data Book.

Serruria furcellata grows in acid, sandy soils at low altitudes between 50-310 m on the Cape Flats. The plant experiences typical Cape Flats weather which is cold and wet during winter and hot, dry and windy during the summer months. The Kraaifontein spiderhead is nearly extinct in its natural habitat in Kraaifontein and Brackenfell. According to Rebelo (1995), in 1987 fewer than 250 plants remained at Northpine on the Cape Flats, and the Elandskloof Mountain population is restricted to a few scattered plants. This is mainly because of urbanization and industrial areas being established in the area.","The seeds are tiny, hard-shelled, oval nuts covered by a fleshy skin called the elaisome. The elaisome secretes a chemical substance that attracts ants. The ants carry the seed to their underground nests where they consume the elaisome. ","Serruria furcellata is grown from cuttings or seed. Tip or heel cuttings are taken during spring or autumn. A rooting hormone is applied to the semi-hardwood cuttings that will stimulate rooting. The cuttings are rooted in a propagation soil mixture of 50% milled pine bark and 50% polystyrene granules. Good rooting of the plant will take place if the propagation greenhouse has good misting and underbench heating. Rooting will take place from 5 weeks onwards. Rooted cuttings are removed from the mist bench and hardened off for 4 weeks. The hardened off cuttings are then potted in a soil medium made up especially for fynbos plants. A suitable well-drained soil mixture consists of composted pine bark, acidic river sand in equal parts loam/topsoil.

Seed is collected from the mature flowerhead. The seed should be sown in late summer or early autumn. The effects of higher day temperatures and cooler night temperatures play an important role in initiating germination. The seeds can also be exposed to short periods of high temperatures followed by cooling water, which, by mimicking the autumn temperature, stimulates the seed to germinate. The seeds should be treated with a fungicide that prevents pre- and post-emergence damping off. The young seedling or cuttings should be grown in an area that is well ventilated and fairly well lit. The plants should be watered in the mornings and may be fed with an organic-based fertilizer. The young plants can be planted out in autumn or in the cooler months before the onset of summer. This will allow the root system to become established and gives the young plant a good chance of survival.

Serruria furcellata is best suited for a garden that has sandy soil. It is a small shrub, so plant it in your garden among other smaller shrubs or slightly taller growing plants. The plant is a resprouter so it should not mind the occasional pruning to keep it neat and compact. Plant in full sunlight, and a layer of composted mulch or woodchips will help keep the soil cool and provide the plant with nourishment.",,,,,,,,
Hony Wort,Erica cerinthoides,,"Erica cerinthoides is an extremely variable species over its distribution range. It varies particularly in growth habit, hairiness of leaves and flowers, and in size, shape and colour of its flowers.

Most of the differences are found in the summer rainfall region resulting in the recognition of a separate variety Erica cerinthoides var. barbertona, which has short flower tubes.

A white flowering form has also been recorded from Mpumalanga and Swaziland.

Erica cerinthoides is one of a few ericas that resprout from a woody rootstock after fire. The result is the production of clusters of lovely inflated, tubular, red flowers at the ends of short branches, which form neat, colourful shrublets in a bleak burnt landscape. Fire thus keeps this plant in good healthy condition and will stimulate flowering at any time of the year. After a number of years they will grow taller, become straggly and produce fewer flowers.

Plants from the southern Cape are known to grow taller than those from other areas. They have been recorded to grow over 1.5m tall if they are not burnt. These specimens may become very woody and devoid of foliage save for at the very ends of their branches where a few leaves and depauperate flowers may be found.","Erica cerinthoides is named after the genus Cerinthe, the honey wort, because of the similarity of the flowers and their arrangement. Francis Masson first introduced Erica cerinthoides into cultivation in England, and it featured in the Botanical Magazine in 1794. It was a favourite species in cultivation at that time, but is seldom seen in cultivation these days.","Erica cerinthoides is the most widely distributed of the heaths in southern Africa. It occurs from the Cedarberg Mountains in the Western Cape, though the Eastern Cape, Transkei, Natal Drakensberg, into Mpumalanga, Lesotho, Swaziland, and as far north as the Soutpansberg in the Northern Province. It is found in different habitats in the Cape where it grows from the coastal plains to the mountain tops.",,"Their ability to survive and respond to fire and to freely produce seed is a major factor in their success as a survivor of adverse growing conditions.

Any plant with such a wide distribution has distinct advantages over those confined to a narrow range. Erica cerinthoides is a tough, well tempered plant that grows easily in different parts of South Africa, and may be expected to survive for a long time in the garden. They require well drained acidic soils (ideal pH between 5.5 and 6.7), and a sunny position. They are suitable for flat beds, or rockeries and do very well in containers where they can be kept compact and well shaped by pruning after flowering. Erica cerinthoides is not hardy to severe frost, but should resprout if damaged by frost. The showy red flowers will attract bird pollinators to the garden.

Feeding is essential for the maintenance of good healthy plants and active plant growth. Regular applications of organic seaweed derived fertilizer will give good results without causing damage to the plants or losses. Controlled release fertilizers such as osmocote or horticote, which release food on warm days in the presence of water, have proved very effective providing that they are low in phosphates and not too much fertilizer is applied to the medium. Follow instructions provided with the product or apply twenty or thirty granules per plant in autumn and spring. Kelpac is also very useful as a stimulant of root growth and for relief of stress caused by heat stress or root disturbance.

Erica cerinthoides is easily grown from seed or cuttings. Seed is sown in autumn and seed that has been treated with the “Instant Smoke Plus Seed Primer” smoke extract show improved germination. A suitable sowing medium consists of two parts acidic river sand : two parts composted pine bark : one part loam. Seedlings germinate after six weeks and are delicate in their early stages. Particular care should be taken to water gently and to protect the seedlings from direct sunlight. Seedlings may be planted out into individual bags or pots once they have grown to a height of at least 1 cm, but only planted out in the garden once they have grown to about 10 cm. Planting should preferably be done in autumn or winter, but they may be planted at other times of the year providing that they are well cared for and watered during the hot months.

Vegetative propagation should be done using proper rooting facilities, i.e. overhead misting and heating from below. These facilities are unfortunately not available to most amateur growers. The best time to root cuttings is in autumn or spring. Fresh actively growing thin shoots taken as heel cuttings and treated with rooting hormone for semi-hardwood material give best results. Roots may develop after eight weeks and are very fine and delicate. Rooted plants should be hardened off away from the mist unit for a few weeks before the cuttings are planted out.",,,,,,,,
Triumfetta annua,Triumfetta annua,,"Triumfetta annua is a spreading, annual herb or shrub, 0.1–9 m tall. The stems are slender, branching from the base, with 1 or 2 rows of hairs. Roots are woody. Leaves are alternate, simple, sometimes lobed, ovate, soft, with simple hairs and serrulate margins. The inflorescence is made up of small, 1–5-flowered cymes clustered together at the nodes. Sepals 5, pale yellow, linear; petals 5, shorter than sepals, yellow; stamens 4–12. Flowering season is in summer. The fruit is a capsule with soft, hooked spines. Seeds ripen in autumn.","The genus Triumfetta was named by Charles Plumier, in memory of Giovani Battista Trionfetti (1655–1708), an Italian botanist and professor of Botany at the University of Rome and Director of the botanical garden of the university. Triumfetta annua has an annual life cycle, hence the specific epithet annua.","According to the Red List of South African plants, Triumfetta annua is listed as Least Concern (LC), i.e. it is not threatened.

Triumfetta is a pantropical genus widespread in warm countries of the world. In southern Africa it occurs in Botswana, North West, Mpumalanga, Gauteng, Swaziland, KwaZulu Natal, Limpopo and Namibia, at an altitude of 330 to 2 100 m. It grows in open sour bushveld, grasslands, mixed woodland, forest stream banks and cultivated land. It is found on alluvial, stony/rocky sandstone, loam, humus rich clay-loam, gravelly silt, or granite, in full or partial shade, full sun and also in intensely hot conditions; also found in well drained, very dry or poorly drained conditions. Triumfetta belongs to the family Malvaceae, the hibiscus or mallow family, in the order Malvales, and the genus was formerly under the family Tiliaceae. There are about 100 species of Triumfetta worldwide. In southern Africa it is represented by 12 species. It has two forms, T. annua forma annua and T. annua forma piligera both of which have since been sunk under one name, Triumfetta annua.",,"Triumfetta annua is rarely cultivated, and if grown it is for its ‘slimy sticks’. It is grown from seed or cuttings. Sow the seed on a hot-bed early in spring. Transplant each into a separate pot filled with light, fresh soil. Water them frequently. Shade them from the sun until they have taken root. As with with other Triumfetta species, make the cuttings 15–20 cm long, harvested from the top end of the stems, plant in shade, in circles with spacing of 10–15 cm. Tie the cuttings to a taller plant for support to ensure that they grow upright, irrigate regularly especially during dry periods. New shoots develop, grow fast and continue to develop, allowing harvest throughout the rainy season.",,,"In East and southern Africa, the young leaves are harvested, cooked as a mucilaginous spinach-like relish and eaten as a leafy vegetable. In West Africa the bark of young green stems called ‘slimy sticks’, are harvested and used to extract a mucilaginous exudate for preparation of a slimy soup called ‘nkwi’.

Flowers are showy, white, in compact, terminal, many-flowered inflorescences, 40–90 mm in diameter. It flowers throughout the year but mainly in spring and summer. The flowers are faintly scented.","The name Selago is derived from sel, which means ‘sight’ and the Celtic word jach, which means ‘salutory’, referring to the supposed medicinal properties of the genus.

The dried flowers produce an orange dye; paniculatus, from the botanical term for a branched inflorescence. Crocosmia paniculata is an attractive species that was evidently a favourite among early gardeners in the midlands of KwaZulu-Natal and the adjacent Eastern Cape, where clumps of a distinctive variant with smaller, bright red flowers can be found around old homesteads or abandoned settlements. It was first recorded in cultivation in Great Britain in 1884, from plants that had been collected in Mpumalanga. The first record of the smaller, red-flowered form dates from 1909, from around Pietermaritzburg in KwaZulu-Natal, where it can still be found today along roadsides and plantations.","Crocosmia paniculata is not threatened, and is assessed as Least Concern (LC) on the Red List of South African plants.

Restricted to the eastern escarpment of southern Africa, from central KwaZulu-Natal through Lesotho and northeastern Free State to Mpumalanga and Swaziland, and into the eastern highlands of Zimbabwe; occurring in rough grassland, usually in moist situations along streams and drainage lines. It is suited to cultivation in temperate and subtropical climates with summer rainfall, and is frost tolerant in winter when dormant. Crocosmia paniculata is one of a small genus of 8 species of Iridaceae restricted to sub-Saharan Africa. DNA sequence analysis suggests that it is closely allied to Freesia. The genus is notable horticulturally for the many striking hybrids that have been produced, primarily using C. aurea, C. masoniorum and C. paniculata. These are popular among northern hemisphere gardeners for their stately form and flamboyant colouring.

The orange, trumpet-shaped flowers are adapted to pollination by sunbirds, which forage for nectar held at the base of the slender floral tube. The curved beaks of the birds fit snugly in the curved floral tube, and the anthers are precisely positioned to dust the top of the bird’s head with pollen, which is picked up by the stigmas of the next flower visited. The hard, round seeds may be dispersed by fruit-eating birds that mistake them for small, reddish berries, but this is not yet known.",,"This species is reasonably cold-hardy, but is unlikely to withstand freezing. In cold regions, either lift the corms in winter or mulch the soil for insulation. If purchased dry, plant the corms well before growth commences in spring, in order that they can hydrate adequately before temperatures rise. Plants grow best in reasonably fertile, friable soils, and in suitable climates, can be left undisturbed to multiply and form large clumps. Climates with hot dry summers, encourage the red spider, which render the leaves unsightly, and the species is best grown in more temperate conditions with moisture during the summer growing season. The main period of growth is in spring and early summer, with flowering taking place in summer. Plants can be expected to die back after flowering in late summer or autumn, and if thinning is necessary, it should be done then or in early spring just before growth resumes. Sow seeds in autumn or spring within 1 or 2 years of harvesting.

Crocosmia paniculata works best as an accent plant when left to form large clumps through natural division, when the pleated leaves are seen to best advantage. It is suited to mixed borders and streamsides.",,,The species is recorded as being used traditionally to treat dysentery and infertility.,,,,,
Eriocephalus,Eriocephalus,Aromatic,"Members of the genus Eriocephalus are woody, evergreen and often aromatic shrubs. The leaves are simple, quite small and covered with pitted glands. The flowerheads may or may not have outer ray florets, which if present are usually white or in some species pink. After flowering, long white hairs develop in the heads so that they have the appearance of fluffy white cotton balls. Flowering time: flowering strongly corresponds to rainfall so that plants in the winter- rainfall region flower from July to September and those in the summer- rainfall regions from January to April.","The generic name, Eriocephalus, is derived from the Greek words erion meaning wool and kephale meaning head and refers to the distinctive densely woolly fruiting heads. The common name applied to species of this genus, kapokbos (Afrikaans - snow bush), refers to the white fluffy fruiting heads that cover the bush, giving the plant the appearance of being covered in snow. This vernacular name is applied to all Eriocephalus species.","E. ericoides lacks obvious outer ray florets (petal-like outer flowers) in flower heads, which are borne on short peduncles and usually arranged in racemes.

E. punctulatus is a more erect shrub that flowers profusely, bearing bright white ray florets.

E. eximius has a compact growth habit, striking close- set silvery leaves and flowerheads with pink ray florets.

E. racemosus is a very large dense shrub with narrow silvery leaves. The discoid heads are arranged in dense racemes, so that the plants are covered in cotton-like balls.E. ericoides, E. punctulatus, E. eximius and E. racemosus are listed as Least Concern (LC) in the Red List of South African Plants (Raimondo et. al., 2009).",,,,,"These plants are readily browsed by livestock and, in combination with other aromatic Karoo shrubs, contributes to the distinctive taste imparted onto the meat, particularly the famous so-called Karoo lamb from these regions. Many of the species of Eriocephalus have been used medicinally for their diaphoretic or diuretic properties (Watt & Breyer-Brandwijk). Eriocephalus ericoides is the most widely used species, with several traditional uses. To ripen measles, an infusion is used together with Angora goat droppings.

To relieve chest ailments in children, an infusion of the seed hairs and a couple of green twigs together with a few drops of harlemensies (derived from the name Haarlem Essence ) is used. An infusion of kapokbos with bitterbos is used in a drink to cure colds (Van Wyk et al., 2008).

A well known essential oil, Cape chamomile, is distilled from Eriocephalus tenuifolius, a close relative of E. punctulatus. It is used in aromatherapy for its anti-inflammatory, anti-allergic, antidepressant and antiseptic properties (Sandasi et al., 2011). To our knowledge, only E. africanus and E. racemosus have been cultivated for the horticultural trade. However, the aromatic nature and medicinal uses of E. ericoides could make it a valuable inclusion in herbal or aromatic gardens.",,,,,

The inflorescence in axillary racemes or terminal clusters, 40–140 mm long, glabrous or pubescent. The flowers are 7–14 mm long, yellow with orange or maroon-purple venation on petals, glabrous or glandular pubescent. The fruit is a small pod, 15–18 × 4–6 mm, glabrous or glandular pubescent.

Flowering time is in spring, summer and autumn (September–June).","The name Rhynchosia is derived from the Greek word, rhynchos, meaning ‘a beak’, 'snout’ or ‘horn’, referring to the keel of the flowers. The specific name adenodes, means ‘with glandular knots’.","According to the Red List of South African plants, Rhynchosia adenodes is assessed as Least Concern (LC), as evaluated against the five IUCN criteria.

Rhynchosia adenodes has a restricted distribution in southern Africa. In South Africa, it occurs in Limpopo, North West, Gauteng, Mpumalanga, Free State, KwaZulu-Natal and the Northern, Western and Eastern Cape. It is also found in Lesotho. It grows in grassland, forest, among rocks, on hillsides.",,"In its natural habitat, Rhynchosia adenodes is a fairly fast grower. There is no evidence of this species being cultivated in gardens. Users of this plant usually harvest it from the wild.",,,"Rhynchosia adenodes is an important medicinal plant in traditional healing in southern Africa, especially for the Basotho, Swazis and Zulu people.

Delosperma abbottii,Delosperma abbottii,,"Delosperma abbottii is mat-forming, and hangs pendent from cliff faces, with stems up to 500 mm long. The roots are fibrous. The branches are 1.8–2.0 mm in diameter, soft and brittle, at first reddish green, becoming grey-green; the internodes 12–15(–30) mm apart; surface glabrous (hairless), or with scattered hairs when young. The leaves are fleshy, flat, egg-shaped to narrowly egg-shaped, occasionally elliptic, 25–35 × 7–12 mm, spreading to slightly recurved, ending into a sharp point; surface shiny green, occasionally hairy when young; the leaf margin entire or hairy.

Flowers are solitary, produced in the leaf axils, up to 20–25 mm in diameter, on pedicels 8–10 mm long; petals magenta, mauve or yellow; the base of the flower (receptacle) is cup-shaped, 3 mm deep and 10 mm in diameter, bearing 2 outer sepals, 7–8 × 4 mm and 3 smaller, 3 × 2.5 mm. The petals in 2 series, outer linear-lanceolate, up to 15 × 1.3–1.5 mm, the inner shorter and narrower 5 × 0.2 mm; stamens in 3 series, up to 3–5 mm long.

Seed pale brown, pear shaped 0.5 × 0.4 mm in diameter, with a rough, tuberculate surface.

Flowering time is spring to autumn, with a peak in midsummer, but occasionally at other times of the year. Delosperma abbottii flowers from spring to autumn, and is mainly pollinated by bees. The seed capsules ripen during summer and autumn. They are hygrochastic, which means they open during rain and close again when it dries out. They have expanding keels, opening and closing the capsule lids. The seeds are splashed out by rain drops, settle in crevices where they germinate. Germination occurs after about 14–21 days.","Delosperma abbottii was named by the author in 2015, to commemorate the farmer, botanical explorer and founder of PlantLife magazine, Tony Abbott (1936–2013), who brought this plant under his attention a number of years ago. A number of Pondoland endemic plants that he discovered have been named in his honour, including, Apodytes abbottii, Lydenburgia abbottii, Maytenus abbottii and Psoralea abbottii (Gunn & Codd 1981).","It is related to Delosperma stenandrum, but D. abbottii is at once distinguished by its procumbent growth habit and bearing larger, dorsiventraly flattened leaves and larger flowers of 20–25 mm in diameter, those of D. stenandrum are only 7 mm in diameter. This recently described species has not yet been evaluated by the Red List of South African Plants. However, Delosperma abbottii grows on cliffs in a relatively stable and safe environment and in the author’s opinion, it is not threatened.

Delosperma abbottii is only known from the narrow kloofs in the northeastern portion of the Eastern Cape to Port Edward in southern KwaZulu-Natal. The habitat consists mainly of river gorges consisting of vertical, mineral-poor, quartzitic, sandstone cliffs, 400–800 m in altitude. Plants grow on various aspects, often in shade, and mainly eastern southern and western aspects, with moderate, coastal-influenced temperatures. Winters are cool and frost absent. Rainfall occurs mainly in summer, but to a lesser extent some in winter, ranging between 1 000–1 250 mm per annum. The habitat consists of subtropical southern, mistbelt forest and coastal sour grassland of the Indian Ocean Coastal belt. Associated cliff-dwelling plants include, Bulbine natalensis, Crassula orbicularis, C. streyii, C. perforata and C. perfoliata, Aloe arborescens and Gasteria croucheri.",,"Delosperma abbottii is easily grown out of doors, in warm, subtropical gardens on steep embankments, terraced gardens or wall-gardens, where it forms mats. Plants require sufficient soil, and regular moisture during the summer months. They grow well in containers, are perfect for hanging baskets. Use a sandy, well-drained soil mixture, and feed with an organic fertilizer to enhance their performance. They grow best in dappled shade. In South Africa it is best for moist subtropical forest gardens (Van Jaarsveld 2010).

Propagation is from seed and vegetative stem cuttings. Seeds are best germinated in a sandy mixture. Sow in spring or summer and cover with a thin layer of gravel or sand and keep moist. Germination should be within 21 days, and the young plants grow rapidly. Cuttings are best rooted in sand and kept moist. This can be performed throughout the year, but best in spring or summer.",,,,,,,,
Barleria prionitis subsp. delagoensis,Barleria prionitis subsp. delagoensis,,"Barleria prionitis subsp. delagoensis is a branched perennial herb or subshrub 0.4-1.5 m high. The leaves are elliptic to lanceolate with the upper halve tapering to a sharp pointed apex (tip) and the lower half tapering to a long or short petiole (leaf stalk). Spines are present in the leaf axils (the angle between the stem and the leaf stalk or a branch).

The flowers are pale yellow to orange, arranged in a loose or fairly dense terminal spike with the lower flowers solitary in the axils of the leaves, in late summer to autumn. The corolla (petals of the flower) is 2-lipped. The upper lip is 4-lobed and the lower lip entire. The lower leaves in the inflorescence are more or less like the normal leaves and the upper leaves are usually much smaller. The bracteoles (small leaf-like structures at the base of the flower) taper to an acute apex.

It has a single seed capsule bearing two seeds. When the seed is ripe the fruit capsule explodes to distribute the seeds in different directions.","Prionitis is Greek and means 'like the holly' or 'saw-edged', and the subspecies delagoensis was named after Delagoa Bay, the name for the Maputo area in southern Mozambique during the colonial days. The genus Barleria is found in Asia, Africa and America. It contains about 250 species with about 70 species in Africa.","Least Concern (LC), this species is not threatened.

Barleria prionitis subsp. delagoensis grows in well-drained sandy soils, in full sun and has been collected in the Kruger National Park, KwaZulu-Natal, Mozambique and Swaziland, where it grows on dune forest edges, rocky outcrops or along roads.",,"Barleria prionitis subsp. delagoensis is propagated either by seed or cuttings:

To prevent seeds being lost, it can be collected as the capsules turn brown. The seeds should be planted in trays in a mixture of two parts good soil and one part clean river sand. Place them in a shady spot in your garden and water once a week. Germination of the seeds takes place after a week. Transplanting the seedlings into bags should be done when the seedlings are more or less 100 mm high.

Cuttings should be made in summer, and you should make use of softwood plant material. Take cuttings of 120 mm length, treat them with a hormone powder and plant them in a mixture of equal parts good soil and river sand. Put the cuttings in a shady place and water twice a week. Transplant the rooted cuttings after about three months into a good soil mixture.",,,,,,,,
Grewia robusta,Grewia robusta,sweetly scented,"Grewia robusta is a multi-stemmed shrub or small tree, up to 3 m high. Its bark is often spiny, and grey. Older stems are roundish.

They are 3-veined from the base, leathery, shiny dark green above, rather paler greyish green below, with short hairs; apex broadly tapering; base rounded, sometimes lobed, almost symmetric; margins have been described as bluntly toothed to scalloped or almost entire, glossy dark green above, pale greyish green and with short hairs below. The petiole (leaf stalk) is very short.

The flowers are small, bright pink and sweetly scented They are solitary, up to 25 mm in diameter, leaf-opposed, with stamens in a central mass. The flowering time is August-December. The fruits are round and fleshy drupes (fruits such as plums), reddish brown and entire to deeply 2- to 4-lobed, up to 20 mm in diameter.","The genus Grewia was named after Nehemiah Grew (1641-1712), an English physician. The specific name robusta is said to refer to the ability of the species to survive hard environmental conditions.","According to Raimondo et al. (2009), Grewia robusta was of Least Concern (LC) when it was evaluated against the five IUCN criteria, as it does not qualify for the categories Critically Endangered, Endangered, Vulnerable or Near Threatened.

Grewia robusta is restricted to the arid areas of the Karoo and the arid parts of Eastern Cape. It generally favours dry scrub, often on stony hill slopes and in valley bushveld.",,"Grewia robusta can be cultivated easily. These trees grow best in moist clay or light sand and medium loam soils, in semi-shade and open areas. Best results are achieved by feeding the plant with organic fertiliser before flowering. Grewia robusta is frost- and drought-tolerant. It produces masses of sweetly scented and attractive pink flowers in summer.

Aloe arborescens,Aloe arborescens,,"The krantz aloe develops into a multiheaded shrub 2 -3m high with striking grey green leaves arranged in attractive rosettes. The leaf margins are armed with conspicuous pale teeth.

The large colourful flower spikes are borne in profusion during the cold winter months (May-July), brightening up a drab winter garden. Deep orange is the most common colour, but there are also pure yellow forms, and an unusual bi-coloured form of deep orange (almost red) and yellow. The inflorescence is usually unbranched, with two to several arising from a single rosette. As with all the aloes, the flowers produce nectar and are attractive to many kinds of birds, in particular the small and colourful sunbirds, which flit from flower to flower in search of nectar. The flowers also attract bees.

The species formerly known as Aloe mutabilis is now regarded as a synonym of Aloe arborescens. It is a cliff dwelling form with smaller, less branched rosettes and red & yellow bi-coloured flower spikes and is more evident on the high inland plateau of the northern provinces of South Africa. This cliff dwelling form of Aloe arborescens can be seen hanging from the cliffs alongside the waterfall at the Witwatersrand National Botanical Garden.

Although it is in fact a large much-branched shrub, Aloe arborescens has been allocated a national tree number (28.1).

","The name aloe is from the Greek alsos and refers to the bitter juice from the leaves of these plants. It is probably derived from the earlier Arabic word alloeh or the Hebrew word allal, both meaning bitter. The Latin word arborescens means tree-forming or tree-like, and is a bit misleading in that this aloe is not really tree-like, but the name was originally applied to this species in reference to the stem-forming habit. The common name krantz aloe refers to its habitat, a krantz being a rocky ridge or cliff.","This species is distributed mainly over the eastern, summer rainfall areas of the country. It has the third widest distribution of any aloe, occurring from the Cape Peninsula along the eastern coast, through KwaZulu-Natal, Mpumalanga and Limpopo province and further north into Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi. It is one of the few aloes that can be found growing at sea level right up to the tops of mountains. The krantz aloe is adapted to many habitats, but is usually found in mountainous areas where it favours exposed ridges and rocky outcrops. It is also found in dense bush. Aloe arborescens is one of approximately 130 Aloe species native to southern Africa. It is possibly the most widely cultivated aloe in the world and can be seen grown in gardens in many cities around the world. It was one of the first South African aloes collected and planted in the Company's Garden in Cape Town. It was grown in Amsterdam by Professor Commelin in 1674, and featured in Hort. Amst. 2 in 1701.",,"The krantz aloe is an easy and rewarding plant to grow, and is a popular garden plant in many countries. It enjoys full sun, well-drained, compost-enriched soil and can tolerate moderate frost but is sensitive to severe frost. It is fast-growing, and it will tolerate drought and neglect once established. It is grown mainly as an ornamental or as an accent plant, but is also an excellent and impenetrable hedge plant.

The krantz aloe is easily propagated from a branch or stem cut off, allowed to dry for a day or so until the wound has sealed, and then planted in well-drained soil or sand. They need not be rooted in any particular place and then transplanted, but can be placed directly into their permanent place in the garden. It is important to remember not to water the cuttings too heavily; overwatering may cause them to rot. This aloe can also be grown from seed, sown in spring. Seed should take three to four weeks to germinate, and the seedlings must be protected from frost",,,".The Zulu people use the leaves of this plant, dried and pounded into a powder, as a protection against storms. Decoctions of the leaves are also used in childbirth and in treating sick calves. In the Transkei it is used for stomach ache and given to chickens to prevent them from getting sick. In the Orient, this aloe is grown in domestic gardens as a convenient first-aid treatment for burn wounds and abrasions. In fact it was only after it was used to treat irradiation burn victims of Hiroshima that its healing properties received attention from the West. Extracts from the leaves have been widely investigated since then and shown significant wound healing, anti-bacterial, anti-ulcer, anti-inflammatory, anti-carcinogenic, hypoglycaemic and also alopoeic activity. The leaves have also been found to have purgative properties and the leaf sap is reported to relieve x-ray burns.",,,,,
klaaslouwbos or Klaas Louw bush,Athanasia crithmifolia,,"A dense, leafy shrub, 1.5–2.0 m tall. Leaves are grey-green, pinnatisect, usually with 3 to 5 lobes cut to the middle of the leaf, and the lobes are long and linear.

Deep yellow flowers are presented in large, showy, flat flower-heads, at branch tips, in summer (October to January). The flower-heads are made up of many small florets packed into rounded discoid heads (i.e. daisy-like flower-heads without the ray petals), that are grouped into simple or compound corymbs (a flat-topped inflorescence where the outer flowers open first).

Athanasia crithmifolia is divided into 2 subspecies, the typical subsp. crithmifolia, and subsp. palmatifida (DC.) Källersjö, which occurs in the southern part of the range and differs in having broadly linear leaf lobes that are palmately cleft in the middle, and the plant is covered in dense, soft, short silky hairs.

Athanasia crithmifolia may be confused with A. trifurcata (trifid-leaf athanasia, coulter bush, klaaslouwbos, kouterbos), and Hymenolepis crithmifolia (also called coulter bush, kouterbos), which flower at the same time.

Athanasia trifurcata has cuneate, usually 3-forked leaves, that are more grey and velvety and not as long and linear as those of A. crithmifolia. It grows on flats and rocky slopes in Namaqualand, through the Western Cape to Port Elizabeth, in the Eastern Cape.

Hymenolepis crithmifolia is a taller shrub, up to 3 m, its leaves longer and more threadlike, and the discoid heads that make up its flower-heads are more loosely clustered and the smaller heads within the compound heads are not as ball-like as they are in the Athanasia heads. It grows on rocky sandstone slopes in Namaqualand and the western part of the Western Cape.","The name Athanasia means ‘without death’, derived from the Greek a- meaning ‘without’ and thanatos, ‘death’, referring to the involucral bracts, which are hard and persist when dry. The species name crithmifolia means ‘with leaves like Crithmium’, commonly called samphire.","Least Concern (LC), neither Athanasia crithmifolia subsp. crithmifolia nor A. crithmifolia subsp. pinnatifida is threatened.

Athanasia crithmifolia grows on sandy flats and slopes, often along drainage lines, in fynbos in the southwestern part of the Western Cape, from Piketberg to Hermanus and the Riviersonderend Mountains. The genus Athanasia is endemic to southern Africa, containing 39 species, 4 of which have 2 subspecies, that occur in the Northern, Western and Eastern Cape, with 1 species extending into KwaZulu-Natal and 1 into Namibia.",,"This plant is not often propagated and grown in the nursery at Kirstenbosch, since it grows quite happily all by itself in the Garden. However, it should be easily propagated from cuttings and is easily propagated from seeds, sown in autumn. Self-sown seedlings can be lifted, potted up and grown on in the nursery. Left to go to seed, it usually seeds itself quite freely, and gardeners should thus also be wary and not allow this plant to escape the garden and invade natural areas outside of its normal range.

It performs best in full sun or semi-shade, in well-drained soil with moderate watering in winter and spring to early summer, and it survives the summer drought typical of the winter-rainfall area, and can be used in water-wise plantings in the winter-rainfall area. It flowers in early to midsummer and is effective in groups in a shrubbery, mixed fynbos beds or in mixed borders. Pinching of the tips in young plants will result in a bushier more floriferous plant. It is not a resprouting plant, and thus should not be pruned harshly. Plants that look leggy and tired should rather be removed and replaced with youngsters.",,,"Athanasia crithmifolia is not used in traditional medicine, nor is it widely grown as a garden ornamental, but it is a good bee plant and useful for water-wise or ‘wild’ areas in gardens, as it largely looks after itself. It is also a useful pioneer species.

Moth Fruit,Acridocarpus natalitus,,"Umabophe can be a small tree, a scrambling shrub, a twiner or a rambling shrub on other vegetation. The tree is 1 to 5 m high, young stems and leaves are sometimes covered with velvety reddish pink hairs that fall off later. Leaves are alternate, simple, shiny dark green and leathery, with prominent midrib and net veins on the undersurface, 30-200 x 10-60 mm.

The bark is grey and rough, and the tips of the branches twine around other vegetation. The bright yellow or golden yellow flowers appear in September to February, in long triangular-shaped sprays that are often found at the ends of branches. The fruit has three but often two large, prominently veined wings that are joined together, which makes it look like a moth with outstretched wings and are normally seen from November to April","The genus name is derived from Greek words, akris which means locust, and karpos meaning fruit, alluding to the winged fruit.

Moth-fruit does not seem to have any pests.",,,"Roots can be mixed with other ingredients to make a mixture (intelezi ) which is used to hinder court procedure. When used in this manner the plaintiff will either become mute, irrelevant or highly repetitive. This results in the case being postponed indefinitely or brought to a speedy end. Herdboys place a piece of the root of umabophe under the tongue to avoid punishment at home after the cattle have strayed into crops. Spermacoce natalensis, which is in the family Rubiaceae is also called umabophe and its roots are used in the same way by herdboys. Roots are also used as intelezi for sprinkling around the homestead during a thunderstorm, to strengthen fighting sticks before traditional competition, to cleanse the whole family (through induced vomiting) after lightning has struck the homestead.

Pycnostachys reticulata,Pycnostachys reticulata,,"Pycnostachys reticulata is a robust, upright-growing, herbaceous shrub that reaches a height of 1.5 to 2 m. The leaves are opposite, narrowly lanceolate, with irregularly toothed margins and a very short stalk. When they are both not in flower, P. reticulata could be mistaken for Leonotis leonurus as they have a similar growth habit and similar-looking foliage.

Pycnostachys reticulata has pale blue and mauve flowers densely crowded into short, spiky spikes, about 50 mm long and 20 mm wide. The inflorescence is terminal on the main or lateral branches. The spikiness comes from the fact that the calyx is made up of 5 spike-like lobes that protrude beyond the buds and are a noticeable feature of the inflorescence.

The inflorescence is made up of mauve-blue buds amongst the reddish-purple spikes of the calyx. The flowers open from the bottom of the inflorescence upwards, forming a pale blue ring around the inflorescence. If you look closely you can see that the flowers are typically salvia-like: - a two-lipped tube. The lower lip is large and boat-shaped and longer than the upper lip.

At Kirstenbosch the plants show some variation in colour, some have pale mauve flowers with pinkish-purple calyx spikes, and at the other end of the scale they have dark reddish-purple spikes and bluish-mauve flowers. Flowering time at Kirstenbosch is late-summer to autumn (March-April). The seed is a small, ovoid nutlet.","The genus name Pycnostachys is derived from the Greek pyknos meaning dense, and stachys actually an ear of corn but in botany a spike, referring to the inflorescence, which is a spike of many flowers densely crowded together. The species name reticulata means a fish net, or netted or a network in Latin, and refers to the veins, which are clearly visible on the underside of the leaf.","Pycnostachys reticulata is the most widespread of the southern African Pycnostachys species. It occurs in the Eastern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal, Swaziland, Mpumalanga, Gauteng, North West, Limpopo and northwards as far as Tanzania. It grows in moist, swampy places and in grassland.

There are 37 species of Pycnostachys that occur in tropical Africa and Madagascar. Only three species occur in southern Africa: P. reticulata, P. urticifolia and P. coerulea. At Kirstenbosch we grow only the two former species. P. urticifolia is commonly known as the nettle-leaved pycnostachys, dark blue pycnostachys, blue boys or hedgehog sage, ystervarksalie (Afr.) and amadata or unkungwini (Zulu). Its leaves are markedly different, greener, broader, almost triangular with rounded teeth and the flowers are a bright gentian blue or pale blue or white.

It occurs in moist places along grassy streambanks and forest margins in Limpopo, Mpumalanga as well as Zimbabwe, Mozambique and Tanzania.",,"Pycnostachys reticulata is easy to grow, not that fussy about soil and can withstand periods of drought, but does best in fertile, well-drained soil in full sun or part shade with ample water. It can be pruned hard after flowering and it will resprout strongly in the spring. Although it is frost tender, it should be able to survive short cold snaps but not prolonged exposure to freezing temperatures.

Pycnostachys reticulata is a good plant for the mixed border, where it provides a striking two-tone colour effect. The flowering stems are long and good for cutting.

Poison star-apple ,Diospyros dichrophylla,,"The poison star-apple is a shrub or tree, normally 2-3 m high, but can grow up to 13 m in some instances. It is single or multi-stemmed with branches that grow straight up, forming a dense canopy.

The bark is grey to brown, and rather smooth or sometimes wrinkled. The young branches and the new growth are covered in soft, yellowish to pale brownish, velvety hairs. The leaves are simple and arranged alternately or spirally. They are narrowly oblong, egg-shaped or oval with bluntly pointed or rounded tips, the base of the leaf narrowing, are glossy, leathery, dark green and hairless above and pale green and sparsely to densely covered with hairs below. The margin is often tightly rolled under, entire and not wavy. The central vein is raised below.

The flowers are borne singly, on long, lax, leaf stalks, are bell-shaped, drooping and creamy white and can be seen from November to March. The 5-lobed calyx and petals curl backwards. The male and female flowers are on separate plants.

The fruit appears from March to October and is an almost round, slightly flattened berry with dense orange-yellow, velvety hairs. The persistent calyx has 5 narrow lobes that usually curve backwards.

There are 3-8 dark, shiny brown seeds.","The word Diospyros was derived from the Greek words, dios, meaning divine, and pyros, meaning grain of wheat. The specific name dichrophylla is based on the Greek words meaning bicoloured leaves. It was cultivated by the Dutch East India Company at the Cape as early as 1815 and was known in gardens of Europe even earlier than that. It is still used for hedges on St Helena (Palmer &Pitman 1972). It is said that the genus Diospyros is the most important one in the Ebenaceae family and about 20 species are found in South Africa.","It is common and widespread in the distribution area. According to Palmer & Pitman (1972), it is difficult to eradicate because of its tough root system.

The poison star-apple is found in coastal scrub, coastal sandy flats, in open grassland, wooded ravines, on wooded rocky hillsides and along forest margins. This species is confined to a wide coastal belt all the way from Montagu in the west, eastward and northwards through the Eastern Cape and along the KwaZulu-Natal coast. It is one of the most common plants on top of the Lebombo Mountains (Palmer & Pitman 1972). Some specimens have been collected in Limpopo, but it does not seem to occur further north of the Soutpansberg. This plant can tolerate some frost, and temperatures ranging between 8º and 39º C, but predominantly prefers the more moist areas with a high rainfall of 1000 mm per year in the summer rainfall areas of South Africa. This plant does well in the Pretoria National Botanical Garden and can tolerate much more drought than indicated from its distribution.",,"It is difficult to root the Diospyros species from tip or semi-hardwood cuttings (Nichols 2005). It is best to make use of fresh seed to propagate the plant as it is the most successful method. To store the seeds, pre-treat them with an insecticide. If stored seeds are used, nick the seed coat before planting, to allow water to penetrate the seeds. Use ordinary seedling mix which can be purchased from any nursery. Sow the seeds from August to October.

Please remember that male and female flowers occur on different plants, so more than one plant is required to ensure pollination and seed formation. The plants are slow growing but extremely rewarding as the female trees bear masses of fruit that are attractive to the eye, and are ideal on the highveld for smaller gardens.",,,"The wood of this plant is hard and black, but is used only for firewood. Since it is claimed that the fruit is poisonous, it is not used for human consumption. It seems that it has only been grown as a garden plant. It makes a lovely little shrub or small tree and can be trimmed to form a hedge like its cousin, Diospyros whyteana. Aside from the edible D. khaki mentioned above, ebony is obtained from a number of tropical species. The more famous South African species is the jakkalsbessie, D. mespiliformis. Another South African species with attractive red fruits is the bluebush, D. lycioides.",,,,,
Curio crassulifolius,Curio crassulifolius,,"Curio crassulifolius is a sprawling, tufted, evergreen, succulent perennial, 150–300 mm high. The stems are smooth and hairless (glabrous). The leaves with a circular cross section (terete) to spindle-shaped (fusiform), 25–60 mm long and 4–8 mm wide, grey-blue-green, fleshy, cylindrical, pointing upwards and ending in a point (mucronate). They are arranged in dense clusters around the tips of the branched stems. The leaves are pruinose, which means that they are frosted with a white bloom. The flower heads are small, discoid, one or a few on slender, elongated flower stalks in late winter, spring and early summer (Aug.–Dec.). They are white to cream or sometimes yellow.","The genus Curio was created in 1997 by P.V. Heath for species of Senecio with elongated, succulent leaves and discoid flower heads. The name is derived from the Latin curiosus meaning ‘curious’, perhaps referring to the peculiar morphology of these plants. The species name crassulifolius, means ‘crassula-leaved’ or ‘leaves like those in the genus Crassula’, referring to its fleshy leaves.","Curio crassulifolius is currently assessed as Data Deficient – Taxonomically Problematic (DDT). In 2009 and 2012 it was assessed as Least Concern (LC), meaning that it is not threatened.

Curio crassulifolius grows on rocky outcrops and ledges and is widely distributed in the Northern, Western and Eastern Cape Provinces, from the Richtersveld to Uitenhage. Ongoing phylogenetic studies in the tribe Senecioneae, have resulted in the description of new genera as well as the re-instatement of some old genera, mainly to reflect the new understanding of the relationships and evolution of species in the genus Senecio. The genus Curio is one of the newly described genera, and contains about 20 species, all formerly in the genus Senecio. Some other species of Curio include, C. articulatus, C. citriformis, C. ficoides, C. radicans, C. rowleyanus, C. muirii, C. pondoensis, C. serpens, C. sulcicalyx and C. talinoides.

Curio belongs in the daisy family (Asteraceae), one of the largest families of flowering plants, containing about 24 000 species found throughout the world.",,"Curio crassulifolius is not known to be used in traditional medicine. It is an easy-to-grow, fast-growing, mat forming, water-wise garden plant that is a useful ground cover for large areas.

Grow Curio crassulifolius in a sunny position in well-drained soil. It will grow in semi-shade but will become lank and leggy. It is drought resistant, and suitable for coastal gardens. It is grown more for its beautiful foliage than for its flowers. It looks good all year and needs minimal care and attention, and little watering. It is useful for creating pockets of colour and/or texture in a mixed planting, as well as for block planting or edging, and mass planting to cover a large area. It is well suited to rocky slopes, rockeries and retaining walls as well as for containers. It is not suited to humid, poorly ventilated areas, or wet or poorly drained soil. Its frost hardiness is not tested at Kirstenbosch, but it is probably able to survive light frosts.

Curio crassulifolius is very easily propagated from cuttings. Bottom heating and misting are not necessary. Take stem material from young or old growth, place in a sandy, rooting medium, keep semi-shaded and watered until it is rooted. Rooting will occur in 3 to 4 weeks. Cuttings can also be planted directly where the plant is intended to be grown. At Kirstenbosch, because Curio crassulifolius is so easily propagated from cuttings, seed propagation has not been attempted.",,,,,,,,
Wild/Natal/Cape laburnum. umkhiphampethu,Calpurnia aurea,,"A multi-stemmed shrub or a small graceful slender evergreen tree 2 - 4 m tall with a light, open crown.

The leaves are compound, up to 20cm long, each having 5-15 pairs of leaflets and a terminal one. The leaflets are oblong 2.5-5cm long with a lopsided base and a rounded or notched apex. They are a fresh light green, graceful and drooping.

The flowers are bright yellow, each about 2.5 cm long, in showy hanging bunches of 8 to 30 flowers. They appear irregularly throughout the year. In summer-rainfall areas the peak flowering period is mid- to late summer (Dec-Feb), but in the winter-rainfall Western Cape, particularly during hot dry summers, they don't flower well in summer but start up again in the autumn. They are typical pea flowers with the banner/standard, keel and wing petals characteristic of the family.

The fruit is a thin pod drying light brown with a papery texture, 5-12 cm long and 0.8-1.9 cm wide, narrowly winged on one side, and containing up to 8 brownish seeds. The pods are indehiscent (do not split open when mature).","The genus Calpurnia is named after the Roman poet Calpurnius. He is thought to be an imitator of the poet Virgil, and since this genus resembles the genus Virgilia named after Virgil, it's poetically just that it be named after Calpurnius. The name aurea means golden (Latin), sylvatica means growing amongst trees (Latin).

It was first described in 1789 from a plant growing in the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, that was said to have been introduced from Ethiopia in 1777.","Calpurnia is a small genus of approximately 16 species, 8 of which occur in southern Africa where they are found in the eastern and north-eastern parts of the country. The other species are: C. capensis, C. floribunda, C. glabrata, C. intrusa, C. reflexa, C. sericea and C. woodii .

Calpurnia aurea is the most widespread of the genus. In southern Africa it occurs from the Eastern Cape through KwaZulu-Natal and Swaziland to Mpumalanga, Gauteng and Limpopo. It also occurs northwards into tropical Africa as far as Ethiopia, and in southern India.

It is found growing in forest, on forest margins and in clearings, on hill sides or on the edge of woody kloofs and in bushveld. In forests it can be a 9 to 15 m tree while in the open it is more often a shrub or small tree 2 - 4 m tall.

Three subspecies were recognized: Calpurnia aurea ssp. aurea, C. aurea ssp. sylvatica and C. aurea ssp. indica. C. aurea ssp. sylvatica is now sunk into C. aurea ssp. aurea.",,"Calpurnia is very easy to grow. It's fast-growing and flowers when young, an excellent shrub or small tree for the garden. It does best in fertile, well-drained soil with plenty of water in summer, but is tolerant of summer drought and should withstand a climate with a winter minimum of -5 °C (zone 9). Grow it in sun or semi-shade, although a plant in full sun will produce more flowers. To keep it small and/or bushy and more floriferous, prune lightly to shape after flowering.

Calpurnia is an ideal small tree for a small suburban garden, or for a tub in an urban courtyard. It can also be planted as a specimen plant on its own in the lawn or a rockery. In time and left to its own devices it can form an interestingly-shaped focal point. Grow it as the backdrop for a herbaceous border, in groups for a mass display.

Calpurnia is easily raised from seed sown in spring or early summer. Soaking in hand-hot water and treating with a fungicide that combats pre-and post-emergence damping off, although not essential for germination, will increase the number of successful seedlings. Seed germinates in 10-14 days. Prick out soon after the first pair of true leaves have developed - taking care not to damage the taproot. Protect young plants from frost.",,,"In South Africa, calpurnia leaves and powdered roots are used to destroy lice and to relieve itches. Unspecified parts are used to destroy maggots and the leaves are used to treat allergic rashes, particularly those caused by caterpillars.

In East Africa, leaf sap is used to destroy maggots in wounds. In Nigeria, the seeds are used to treat abscesses. In Ethiopia it is used to treat stomach complaints, headache, eye diseases, amoebic dysentery, scabies and as an insecticide.

The wood is yellowish with a dark brown heartwood that is heavy and hard but not much used.",,,,,
Moraea villosa,Moraea villosa,light sweet scent,"Moraea villosa is a perennial cormous geophyte which grows up to 40 cm tall. Stems are soft and hairy. Plants have a single, narrow, hairy leaf which is attached near the base of the stem. The leaf is normally as long as, or often longer than the stem. Moraea villosa bears large showy flowers with a light sweet scent. The three large outer of subsp. villosa can be various shades of purple, lilac or pink.

Subsp. elandsmontana has bright orange flowers. The inner edges of the outer tepals are marked by yellow nectar guides, which are bordered by broad conspicuous crescent-shaped bands of iridescent green, blue and navy, resembling the lustre of peacock feathers. The smaller inner tepals are three-lobed, the outer lobes are small and rounded, while the middle lobe is long and slender. The style is divided into three flattened branches resembling small petals terminating in paired crests. The anthers are attached to the underside of the style branches.

Moraea villosa flowers between August and September and the flowers last several days. Small angular seeds are contained in cylindrical capsules.

","The genus Moraea was first described as Morea in honour of the English botanist Robert More (1703-1780), but Linnaeus later changed the name to Moraea after the surname of his wife, Elisabeth Moraea and his father-in-law, Johan Moraeus (Goldblatt & Manning 2008). The genus consists of ± 195 species (Manning 2007) and occurs throughout sub-Saharan Africa, extending to the Middle East. Most species (173) are indigenous to South Africa, where they are concentrated in the winter-rainfall region. Moraea villosa is part of a group of Moraea species including Moraea aristata (CR), Moraea tulbaghensis (EN) and Moraea gigandra (EN) known as the 'peacock moraeas'. They share the characteristic of large iridescent markings on the outer tepals and are some of the most striking, but sadly also most threatened members of the genus. Moraea villosa is named for its hairy stems and leaves (villous meaning hairy or shaggy), the distinguishing feature of this species. It was discovered between 1772 and 1775 by the Swedish botanist Carl Peter Thunberg, a student of Linnaeus who is often called `the father of Cape botany' (Gunn & Codd 1981). Thunberg was one of the first European botanists to explore the Cape Flora, and during his three years at the Cape discovered more than 3000 new plant species.

Subsp. elandsmontana was discovered by the botanical artist Fay Anderson in 1979. The painting of her discovery can be seen in the illustrated monograph of the genus by Peter Goldblatt (Goldblatt 1986).","Moraea villosa subsp. villosa is classified as Vulnerable due to its restricted range, few remaining populations and declining habitat. Although a few large populations of several thousand plants remain, most populations consist of only a few plants confined to small, isolated habitat fragments. Populations on these small fragments, which are surrounded by crop fields, are threatened by a lack of fire (which stimulates flowering), loss of pollinators, pollution by pesticides and fertilizer, and invasion by alien plants, particularly grasses, which find favourable habitat in the fertilizer-enriched soil.

Moraea villosa subsp. elandsmontana is also classified as Vulnerable, due to its small population size. Only one population of about 350 plants is known. This population is protected in the Elandsberg Private Nature Reserve, and is not otherwise affected by any threats.

Moraea villosa is endemic to the Western Cape. Subsp. villosa occurs at low altitude (below 300 m) between Gordon's Bay, Ceres and Piketberg, although it is now largely extinct in the southern part of the range. Subsp. elandsmontana occurs in a small area at the foot of the Elandskloof Mountains near Gouda.

Both subspecies occur in fynbos and renosterveld and prefer stony clay soils derived from shale and granite. Subsp. villosa is also sometimes found in sandy soils.",,"Moraea villosa is easy to grow, and will make an attractive plant in a small garden or pot. Plants can be grown from either seeds or corms. Seeds germinate easily, but plants grown from seed may take up to two or three years to flower. Seeds or corms should be planted in well-drained soil in late March or April. Plant corms two to three times as deep as their diameter. Water sparingly, and avoid over-use of fertilizer. At the end of the flowering season, lift corms to prevent insect damage and rotting.",,,"Generally, the corms of some Moraea species were an important part of the diet of hunter-gatherer tribes, while others are poisonous to livestock (Manning 2007).",The corms of some Moraea species are poisonous to livestock (Manning 2007).,,,,
Encephalartos natalensis,Encephalartos natalensis,,"Encephalartos natalensis is an evergreen quick-growing cycad, up to 6.5 m high and with a stem or trunk of about 0.4 m in diameter. The stem sometimes branches, but reclines only when other stems emerge from the base. It has a golden, woolly crown, which increases on production of cones or new whorls of leaves. The leaves are of medium size, about 1.5-3 m long and slightly curved or straight. The leaflets are about 160-230 x 25-45 mm, dark green and entire or with 1-5 teeth on one or both margins. The lower leaflets are reduced to spines. New leaves and cones are covered with yellowish brown wool. There are separate male and female plants; both genders produce 2 or 3 orangy-yellow to orangy-red cones.

The male cones are cylindrical, yellowish-green, velvety, about 450-500 mm long, and 90-120 mm across, and shed their pollen in April to June. The female cones are oblong to oblong-ovate, about 500-600 mm long and 250-300 mm in diameter. The faces of the cone scales are wrinkled. The cones disintegrate spontaneously from November to January, each yielding 415-510 bright red seeds which are about 25-35 mm long and 12-18 mm in diameter.","The name Encephalartos was derived from a Greek word for bread in head and refers to the floury, starchy material in the trunk of some species used traditionally as food. The specific name natalensis means from Natal, which is now KwaZulu-Natal. This cycad is the most variable of all Encephalartos species. It is closely related to E. altensteinii, a species that occurs in the Eastern Cape. It was considered to be part of the E. altensteinii complex until Dyer & Verdoorn separated the two species in 1951.","Through the years, vast numbers of Encephalartos natalensis have been removed from their natural habitat, primarily for landscaping purposes. According to Raimondo et al. (2009), Encephalartos natalensis is regarded as Vulnerable (VU). This is the category used when the best available evidence indicates that the plant meets any of the five IUCN criteria for Vulnerable. Therefore it is probably facing a high risk of extinction in the wild.

Encephalartos natalensis is endemic to South Africa, occurring from Tabankulu in the northern part of the Eastern Cape, through most of KwaZulu-Natal, up to the upper catchment area of the Umfolozi River, near Vryheid in the north. It grows on cliffs, in forests, and on rocky outcrops, where the climate is hot in summer and cold in winter, with frost occurring regularly. The altitude is about 1200 m above sea level. E. natalensis can be differentiated from E. altensteinii, because the former's lower leaflets are reduced to spines. It can also be confused with E. msinganus, which was considered to belong to E. natalensis until it was described as a new species by P.J. Vorster in 1996. E. msinganus has narrow leaflets, about 16-20 mm wide, and its female cone is warty. E. natalensis is also closely related to E. lebomboensis, E. senticosus and E.woodii.",,"Propagate from seed. Encephalartos natalensis grows relatively quickly and thrives in light shade or sun. Plant it in a well-drained rich soil mixture and give it moderate moisture. Some forms of E. natalensis are much more frost resistant than others, but give all of them some protection from cold when young. Plant seedlings into the garden when about 3 years old, and with leaves about 1 m long. Remove any old and dead leaves.","Cycads are regarded as ""living fossils"", as their relatives have been found as fossils in rocks dated back to the Triassic Era. This means that during that era these plants could have been dinosaur food!",,"The bark of Encephalartos natalensis is harvested for the muthi trade in most parts of K waZulu-Natal. It is also grown as an ornamental plant in gardens. In times of famine the pith of the stem was used as a substitute for bread flour, hence the common names.",,,,,
Campanulaceae,Campanulaceae,,"In South Africa the family contains mostly herbs (annual, or perennial) or rarely small shrubs. The leaves are alternate, rarely opposite, simple, and without stipules.

The flowers are regular, bell-shaped, funnel-form or salver-form (corolla with a narrow tube and small spreading lobes) and bisexual. They are borne singly or more often in inflorescences. The large, showy flowers are predominantly blue in colour. Petals, sepals and stamens are normally in fives. The petals are partially or completely fused and are inserted on an inferior or half inferior or seldomly a superior ovary. There are as many stamens as corolla lobes. The style is simple with as many stigmas as carpels.

The fruit is a capsule.

",,"The Campanulaceae has a cosmopolitan distribution, although more abundant in temperate and subtropical regions, and consists of about 55 genera and more than 900 species. In South Africa there are 10 genera of which eight are endemic, and about 250 species. Some of the genera are discussed below.

The largest and most widespread genus is Wahlenbergia, which comprises 170 species. W. capensis is a common blue-flowered spring annual that is often found along roadsides and on open fields around Cape Town. Most of the annual species occur on the West Coast, as well as in the Northern Cape in sandy soil in open vegetation. Recently all 46 species of the shrubby genus Lightfootia have been placed in Wahlenbergia.

Roella is a genus of small shrubs found mainly in the southwestern Cape. Only one of the twenty-four species extends into the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal. Plants grow mainly on stony mountain slopes. Its large blue flowers are borne on the tips of branches in groups or singly. The best known species in this genus is R. ciliata.

Rhigiophyllum is one of two genera consisting of only a single species. The other one is Treichelia. Rhigiophyllum squarrosum is a small shrub, which occurs only in the Napier-Bredasdorp area, whereas Treichelia longebracteata is an annual known from a few localities in the Cape Peninsula and one in Hermanus.

The regular and irregular flower shapes of members of the Campanulaceae have always been the subject of dispute and uncertainty. Some taxonomists prefer to consider the Campanulaceae as one complex, variable family with several subfamilies. New evidence from morphology and DNA sequence data has contributed to the current recognition of five subfamilies within the Campanulaceae: Campanuloideae, Lobelioideae, Cyphiodeae, Cyphocarpoideae and Nemacladiodeae. Only the Campanuloideae, Lobelioideae and Cyphiodeae are represented in South Africa, the other two subfamilies occurring in Chile, southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. For the purpose of this article, I consider the Campanulaceae in the strict sense, that is, not recognising subfamilies, instead recognising the families Campanulaceae, Lobeliaceae and Cyphiaceae.

Class: Angiospermae (dicotyledons) Order: Asterales

Many of shrubby members of the family which occur in the fire-prone fynbos vegetation of the southwestern Cape resprout after fire. Plants in the genus Merciera grow and flower most profusely in recently burnt veld. After six years, the plants start to die, disappearing when the veld remains unburnt for very long periods. Plants in the dry parts of the country have adapted to long periods of drought by developing an annual life cycle.",,,,,,,,,,
Grewia hexamita,Grewia hexamita,lovely scented ,"Grewia hexamita is a large, multi-stemmed shrub or small tree, 5 m high. It has a rough, dark grey bark.

The leaves are alternate and elliptic to oblong-elliptic, 30-100 x 25-60 mm, with a rounded or tapering apex. They are 3-veined from the asymmetrically lobed base, leathery, dark glossy green above and paler below, and the margins are serrated. The leaf stalk is about 3-6 mm long.

The flowers are golden yellow, large, about 50 mm in diameter and there are 2 or 3 per stalk. The buds are velvety and reddish. The flowers are honey-scented and arranged in axillary clusters at the end of branches. The flowering time is September-December.

The fruits are large, round and shiny, reddish brown drupes, entire to deeply 2-lobed, up to 20 mm in diameter.","The genus Grewia was named after Nehemiah Grew (1641-1712), an English physician. The specific name hexamita refers to six threads, but the meaning is obscure. Grewia hexamita is sometimes mistaken for G . monticola, the leaves of which are much paler, the fruit much smaller, and the veins woolly and without long hairs.","According to Raimondo et al. (2009), Grewia hexamita was of Least Concern (LC), when it was evaluated against the five IUCN criteria and does therefore not qualify for the categories Critically Endangered, Endangered, Vulnerable or Near Threatened.

Grewia hexamita occurs naturally in open grasslands and in sparse, dry woodlands. It is found in KwaZulu-Natal, the lowveld and northwards to Tanzania.

",,"Grewia hexamita can be grown from seeds, but germination is unpredictable. For best results collect seeds from warthog and baboon droppings. Such seeds germinate better, as mentioned above. These trees grow best in temperate climates with summer rainfall. They do not require much water and are frost-hardy. The initial growth of Grewia hexamita is 1 m or more in height per year. Thereafter it grows more slowly as the plant thickens out. Normally it will start bearing flowers and fruits when about two or three years old.",,,"This Grewia has heartwood like ebony.

Hibiscus praeteritus,Hibiscus praeteritus,,"Hibiscus praeteritus is a fast-growing, slender shrub, 0.6-2.0 x 1 m. The ovate, coarsely serrated leaves are either arranged alternately or in a cluster. In most cases the leaf surfaces are slightly hairy. Hairs appearing on the stems are generally closely apressed. The pink or red flowers have five petals, 25-30 mm in diameter. The flower colour normally darkens with age. The fruit is a 10 mm green capsule with a 30 mm stalk. The seeds turn black when ripe and are covered with a creamy-white, cottony floss.",The name Hibiscus is derived from the Greek word for marshmallow.The specific epithet praeteritus means to be passed over.,"Hibiscus praeteritus is not threatened and has the status of Least Concerned (LC) (Raimondo et al. 2009).

Hibiscus praeteritus is a very widespread species found in Limpopo and Mpumalanga where it grows in bushveld and rocky hillsides at about 700-1100 m. Outside South Africa it extends into Namibia, Malawi, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Angola and Botswana. In these localities plants normally receive summer rainfall with extremely dry winters. Frost occurs occasionally. Worldwide the genus Hibiscus consists of more than 200 species. In South Africa there are approximately 59 species and they range from perennial and aromatic herbs to shrubs and trees.

Hibiscus is very popular in South Africa as a garden ornamental. Exotic species such as H. splendens, H. rosa-sinensis and its cultivars adorn many a garden in South Africa. From the species indigenous to South Africa, H. tiliaceus (wild cotton tree), H. calyphyllus (sun hibiscus), H. dongolensis (Dongola hibiscus), H. meyeri (Lebombo hibiscus) and H. praeteritus will be sure winners in gardens. H. praeteritus is not readily available commercially and perhaps once its true potential as a garden subject is realized, it will get the attention it deserves. With the variability in flower size, shape, growth form and leaf texture within the 59 South African species, there is great potential in the breeding arena.",,"Sow seed in a 1:1 mixture of fine bark and coarse river sand during the spring or early summer. Germination can take up to 2-5 weeks. Results are usually very erratic.

The most effective way to propagate this species is by doing it vegetatively. Take stem cuttings during spring or summer. Use a well-draining medium such as a 1:1 mixture of fine bark and river sand, 1:1 fine bark and polystyrene or plain coarse river sand. Place cuttings in a mist unit, where rooting of 90-100 % will occur in 2-3 weeks.

H. prateritus is a fast-growing shrub and should be planted in a sunny position in well-drained soil. It responds well to fertilizer treatment. In frost-prone areas, it should be allocated the warmest part of the garden. Do not overwater this plant which has once been described as almost resistant to drought. For a good effect, use it in a rockery, or plant en masse in a mixed border.

Its young branches are densely leafy, 4-7 mm in diameter, square, distinctly ribbed when young, green, becoming purplish and round (terete). Its older branches can thicken up to 50 mm in diameter at the base (rarely up to 70 mm), becoming brown and eventually grey and smooth. Its leathery, green, slender and flattened leaves (linear oblanceolate, 65-125 x 5-9 mm) are ascending and carried in whorls (4-verticillate, occasionally 3-verticillate). The petiole is short. Young leaves are soft, shiny and viscous, due to minute glandular hairs soon becoming smooth. Leaf margins are slightly thickened, and bearing 4-8 pairs of small teeth in the upper third of the leaf.

The striking, yellow, tubular flowers are carried in whorls. The broadly tubular flowers are 27-30 x ± 30 mm, the corolla is two-lipped (5 lobed, 2 upper and 3 lower) and spreading, the youngest flowers opening from stem top downwards.

Ecklon, a Danish pharmacist and plant collector, settled in Cape Town in 1823 to further his experience. Zeyher, a German botanical collector came to the Cape in 1822. Ixianthus was named by the botanist Bentham in Hookers Botanical Magazine. The genus name is derived from Greek, but the reference is not very clear: ixos is mistletoe or birdlime; the genus Ixia was named for its viscous sap; anthos is flower; retzioides means 'like the genus Retzia'.","Ixianthes retzioides is not threatened.

River bells is confined to the upper reaches of the Olifants River and its tributaries and also above Tulbagh near the waterfall in the Groot Winterhoek Mountains, Western Cape. The climate is hot and dry during summer but moist during the wet winters. The shrubs occur on streambanks in cool, swift and fast-flowing water, often with their roots in the water. The plants grows in association with Metrosideros angustifolia, Brachylaena neriifolia and the palm, Prionium serratum.",,"Although it grows readily from cuttings and thrives in containers, also flowering soon, the plants rapidly die when planted out in similar habitats. In spite of several attempts to grow the plants at Kirstenbosch, no success has been achieved even when planted next to strong flowing streams.

Cuttings root rapidly in a sandy mixture under mist propagation during spring and summer. Attempts are now under way to graft stock onto closely related, but easily grown Bowkeria or Anastrabe species from the northern and eastern parts of South Africa and once achieved will be released into gardens (see grafting below).

It is best grown as a container plant. Due to its acidic sandstone habitat the plants are best grown in a fynbos potting mixture (a quartzitic sandstone-based, well-drained mixture). For best results, water frequently during the dry summer months.

Grafting and budding:

Why do we graft or bud a plant? Not all plants are easy to grow and especially those confined to specialized habitats such as a fast flowing streambank. Also some have weak or disease-prone rootstocks. When a useful or attractive (agricultural or ornamental horticultural) plant is difficult to grow on its own rootstock (such as the river bells), grafting is often the answer. By using a closely related plant which is better able to cope with conditions in cultivation as a stock or host plant, the problems associated with growing the plant are sometimes overcome.

Examples include various fruit trees and other ornamentals such as roses and many other tree and shrub species. Success has been achieved with the rare and difficult to grow indigenous marsh rose, Orothamnus flabellifolius, which has successfully been grafted onto Leucadendron conocarpodendron. The impala lily, Adenium multiflorum, from dry, subtropical and tropical regions in Africa has been grafted onto Nerium oleander in Europe. The author has also successfully grafted plants of the large-leafed spekboom, Portulacaria armiana, onto the spekboom, P. afra.

Grafts are usually performed with a close relative or at least a member of the same family. Many difficult members of the stapeliad family have been grafted onto Ceropegia woodii rootstock with great success. There are various methods of grafting or budding. In the latter a single bud is transferred into a slit made into the bark of the host and the bud slipped in, and covered with plastic wrapping. Grafts are made with shoots of the desired plant inserted into slits in the stock plant and held in place until the bark/outer layer of both plants has grown together.",,,,,,,,

The short shoots are covered with whitish, woolly, clustered leaves, which are minute, tufted and pressed to the stem, giving the plant a granular appearance.

In the wild there are different forms, varying in colour. The silver-grey form that is grown at Kirstenbosch is usually found at higher altitudes and has slightly thicker stems.

The flowerheads are grouped in small clusters towards the ends of the main shoots, forming a spike-like inflorescence. Pale brown bracts surround the purple disc florets and give the spikes a golden appearance. Flowering is mainly in autumn/winter, from April to June, but also in spring.","The name Seriphium is derived from seriph, a stroke or line of a letter; plumosum means feathery. There is speculation whether the common name slangbos is derived from the fact that the flowerheads look like a snake rearing its head or from unsuspecting individuals finding a cobra curled up under it.","The genus Stoebe consisted of 34 species occurring mainly in the Western Cape (25 species) but also in southern tropical Africa, Madagascar and Reunion. It was recently revised by Koekemoer (2002) and Stoebe plumosa was combined with some other stoebes as Seriphium plumosum. S. plumosum is quite common and has a widespread distribution throughout South Africa. The species' light colour, which reflects sunlight, woolly covering and small leaves, which reduce water loss, are adaptations to survive long, dry summers. It is an aromatic plant, yielding volatile oil, which is also a protective measure as the plant is seldom eaten by stock and then only when the plant is young. This is the very reason why the form of Seriphium plumosum which was previously known as Stoebe vulgaris has become such a problem in the northern parts of the country where it proliferates in disturbed or overgrazed areas, explaining its common name, the bankrupt bush.",,"Seriphium plumosum is evergreen and fast growing, with a height and spread of about a metre. Plant in full sun in well-drained soil or on a slope and keep fairly dry in summer. It looks most natural when combined with other fynbos, especially proteas and restios. Where less of a contrast and a more natural look is desired, use in variegated, grey and yellow planting schemes. For the best effect plant it in groups and give it space to spread or keep in shape with a regular light prune.

At Kirstenbosch slangbos is propagated vegetatively. Tip cuttings are taken in spring, treated with a rooting hormone and inserted into a 50% bark, 50% polystyrene medium and placed on 24°C bottom heat under a mist system. Rooting usually takes three weeks. Cuttings can also be rooted in coarse river sand in cold frames. Seed is also an option and is sown in autumn.",,,"The form of Seriphium plumosum which was previously known as Stoebe plumosa was not used medicinally. However, in the Western Cape, the form previously known as Stoebe cinerea is still used as a remedy for heart trouble, whereas another unidentified Stoebe/Seriphium sp. that smells like valerian, may have a beneficial effect in epilepsy. The plant makes very good kindling for fires, so good in fact that it should not be grown too close to a house in high fire risk areas. It is also used as nesting material in aviaries, tightly stuffed into chicken-wire baskets or nesting boxes, and is favoured by zebra finches. Any outdoor enthusiast will testify that the plant makes very good bedding material.",,,,,
Persimmon or Tolbos,Diospyros austro-africana,,"Diospyros austro-africana is a multistemmed shrub or small tree, somewhat rounded, 2 to 10 m high. The bark is medium to dark brown with fine, flakey strips. The brown branches are finely haired, similar to the fine hairs on the small, narrow-obovate leaves which give this shrub a dusty grey appearance.

The leaves are whorled and crowned at the tips. They are 35 x 2-5 mm, subsessile, oblanceolate, slightly darker and velvety on top and felted beneath.

The flowers are pendulous, creamy white, cherise-pink or red. Each flower is surrounded by a 5-lobed calyx which holds the developing fruit and is unique to Diospyros. Plants are dioecious, either male or female. Flowering time: August to November.

Round, fleshy fruits are borne from January to June. These are also velvety and ripen red to black. The fruit is usually 15 mm in diameter.","The common name of the genus Diospyros is persimmon or tolbos. It is characterized by: the calyx (composed of sepals) which usually increases in size after flowering; the ovary is borne on a smooth, hairless disc; fruits carry 2 or more seeds; leaves are alternate.","Diospyros austro-africana is not a threatened species.

There are four varieties of Diospyros austro-africana (a variety is a natural subdivision of a species):

var. austro-africana occurs in the Western Cape regions and north towards Namaqualand;

var. microphylla is the most common and widespread, occurring in the Western Cape, Northern Cape, Free State and further north of the Vaal River;

var. rubiflora occurs inland from the Free State, Lesotho to KwaZulu-Natal;

var. rugosa occurs in the Western Cape.

Generally this is a water-wise plant that can tolerate cold temperatures and severe frost. It is suited to the winter rainfall regions of Western Cape, KwaZulu-Natal and northern South Africa.

Diospyros austro-africana belongs to the family Ebenaceae. It was previously known as Royena hirsuta. There are two genera in South Africa, Diospyros and Euclea.There are 500 species in the genus and these are found in pantropical and tropical areas. Diospyros is derived from the Greek, dios meaning divine, and pyros meaning wheat or grain.

Diospyros austro-africana is water-wise with characteristics such as tiny leaves and felt-like hairs.",,"Even though this plant is considered water-wise, moderate watering will benefit it, as well as a good potting mix with compost. Diospyros austro-africana is slow growing, a good rockery plant and can be used in a mixed border or as a screening shrub.

It is grown from seed. Propagate from seeds as the cuttings are very difficult to root. Fresh seeds grow much better than stored seeds. Collect the seeds when ripe and clean them as soon as possible. Use 50% sand and 50% seedling mixture in the trays. Cover the seeds with the mixture. Place the trays on hotbeds and do not allow them to dry out.

The seeds will germinate within three weeks. After a week of germination, allow the seedlings to harden off. Seedlings can be transplanted after a month in the hardening off area or can stay in the seedling tray for years. The plants need full sun and well-drained soil.",,,The wood of Diospyros austro-africana is used to make fire. The fruits are also edible. This shrub has good potential as a bonsai.,,,,,
Gerbera ambigua,Gerbera ambigua,,"This species is highly variable in terms of leaf structure and inflorescence colour. It is a stemless perennial herb with a basal rosette of leaves emerging from a silky crown. The cylindrical roots are thick and fleshy. Leaves are very variable in shape, size, petiole length and indumentum (covering of hairs).

Flower stalks (up to 35 cm) emerge from the crown and bear a single inflorescence (""flower"") which is up to 5 cm in diameter. The ray florets are commonly white with a pinkish underside, or more unusually, yellow, with a coppery underside. The pappus hairs, which give the daisy centre its colour, may be deep purple or cream. Hilliard (1977) grouped the dark-centred forms with white-felted leaf undersides and strongly raised midrib and side veins into a separate species, G. kraussii, which has subsequently been incorporated into G. ambigua by Hansen (1984). Flowers occur mainly from September to December but may be found throughout the year.

Pale centred form

","The genus Gerbera was named by Jan Gronovius in 1737 for the Gerber brothers: Fr. Gerber, who collected plants in the West Indies , and Traugott Gerber, a German medical doctor baptised in 1710, and the curator of the oldest botanical garden in Moscow . In spite of extensive investigations, no link or reason has been found for the choice of their name for the genus (Ambrosius 2003). The specific name ambigua is derived from the Latin for 'doubtful' or 'uncertain' and is an epithet often applied to highly variable species.

Gerbera kraussii was first collected 'near Pietermaritzburg' by Christian Krauss, a prolific collector of plants in South Africa, between 1838 and 1840.","Gerbera ambigua is not threatened.

Widespread throughout Africa from the coast to about 1900 m, this species is found in grassland, open woodland and damp areas. The fleshy roots enable it to survive both dry, cold winters and annual fires which are typical of most of the region in which it is found.",,"Propagation of Gerbera ambigua can be done by using either seed or divisions. Seed should be collected at dispersal time and sown within three months. If they can not be sown immediately, they should be kept under normal storage conditions. Viable fruits can be distinguished as they are plump and firm to pressure. Use a well drained medium and keep moist. Germination occurs within two weeks and seedlings can be 'pricked out' as soon as they are large enough.

Large clumps of mature plants can be lifted, preferably in late winter, and gently divided into smaller pieces.

Plant into well-drained and composted soil in full sun or very light shade. Water as little as possible in winter.

All gerberas are prone to fungal discoloration of the leaves from midsummer onwards. This can be treated by spraying with a commercial fungicide.

Gerbera ambigua makes a fine edging plant with its low-growing habit, attractive leaves and pretty white or yellow flowerheads. The dark-centred forms are especially attractive. As it contrasts well with indigenous tufted grasses, it is a good choice for a 'natural' grassland planting. It is also a useful rock garden subject.",,,"Pounded leaf infusions of Gerbera ambigua are used in Zulu traditional medicine for tapeworm and stomach ache, whereas root infusions are taken orally for coughs. In Zimbabwe, root infusions are used for heart pain and abdominal pain in babies.",,,,,
Ruschia maxima,Ruschia maxima,sweet-sceted,"This large erect perennial shrub can spread more than 1 m. The branches are woody and tough with short internodes. It also has very large, opposite, three-sided leaves with a reddish tint on the leaf tips.

Flowers are small with purple petals with a cone of stamens. When flowering, the plant is covered in sweet-scented flowers. Flowering can take place at any time of the year, but most Ruschia species flower from September to November. Mature fruits of this plant are small, hard and contain 4 or 5 locules.

","Ruschia was named after a farmer, Mr. Ernst Rusch, of the farm Lichtenstein, near Windhoek (Namibia). There are more or less 51 species in this genus. Ruschia can easily be mistaken for Lampranthus or Drosanthemum, which all fall under the same family, Mesembryanthemaceae (Aizoaceae). Lampranthus and Drosanthemum have much bigger flowers and a wider colour range than Ruschia . Ruschia maxima, however, is the largest amongst the Ruschia species.","This species is not threatened.

Ruschia maxima occurs in the Western Cape near the coast and inland towards Clanwilliam and the Bobbejaansberge, at altitudes of 300-800 m. Many specimens have been found on north-facing slopes and they can tolerate rainfall ranging from less than 100 mm to 800 mm per year. Ruschia maxima can tolerate frost and fires. It is found in different habitats and grows in all kinds of soil, derived from sandstone, quartzite, clay and shale. The genus Ruschia is widespread in South Africa and occurs in summer rainfall regions too.",,"Ruschia maxima can easily be propagated from seed or cuttings.

Sow seeds in February or March in a well drained medium consisting of 2 parts coarse river sand, 2 parts fine, sieved compost and 1 part perlite. When sowing, do not overcrowd the tray that you are sowing in, so that your seedlings do not have to compete for nutrients. The transfer of fungal diseases is also minimised. Treat the soil medium with an antifungal agent for maximum results.

Heel cuttings (where a piece of stem tissue is attached) must be made during the warmer seasons with sterilized secateurs and in a medium which is well aerated, like coarse river sand. Apply a rooting hormone to stimulate root growth.

Care should be taken, since root hairs can die off if not watered regularly.",,,,,,,,
Sarcocaulon,Sarcocaulon,,"Sarcocaulon is a genus of succulent, spiny shrublets with short stems, branching just above soil level. The fleshy branches are prostrate, semi-erect or erect, covered with waxy, translucent bark.

Dimorphic (two forms) leaves characterise the genus, with the blades either long or shortly petioled. The long petioles occur singly and remain as blunt or sharp spines, and the short ones occur singly or in groups of 2-7 in the axils of the long spines as blunt stalks. The leaf blades are often folded, unsegmented or segmented, and vary in outline from elliptic to ovate to obovate (egg-shaped with the broadest part above) with the bases usually tapered. The tips are notched and the margins entire, lobed or toothed.

The flowers, subtended by 2 bracts, appear solitary in the axils of the leaves. They are pedunculate (stalked), 5-merous with the sepals of the calyx and the petals free. The margins of the sepals are membranous and the tips end abruptly in a short, stiff point. The thin, delicate petals are inversely egg-shaped (obovate) to almost squared off (subtruncate) at the tips and wedge-shaped at the bases, usually glabrous, sometimes covered with soft, short, erect hairs or fringed with hairs along the edge. Fifteen stamens, 5 with long filaments and 10 with shorter filaments, are characteristic of Sarcocaulon.

Members of the Geraniaceae family have a peculiar dry fruit with the carpels much elongated. At maturity only the inner parts of the united carpels remain as a central column, whereas the outer part of each carpel, enclosing one seed at the base, lifts off. In Sarcocaulon the seeds and the sterile upper part of the carpel become completely detached. The tail is thin, readily absorbs moisture (hygroscopic), and has long weak hairs (villous).","The name Sarcocaulon alludes to the Greek words for fleshy, sarkos, and stems, caulon.

The genus Sarcocaulon was established by A.P. de Candolle in 1824 as a section of the genus Monsonia, described by Linnaeus. Two years later, Sweet raised the section to genus level, followed by Knuth in his monograph of the family Geraniaceae in 1912. The account on Sarcocaulon here is based on the excellent study and revision of the genus published by Rodney Moffett in 1979. Although the genus is closely related to Monsonia, it is regarded as a sister genus and not a synonym of Monsonia.","The Geraniaceae family is widely distributed and consists of mainly annual or perennial herbs and shrublets, comprising about 700 species. Members of Sarcocaulon are mainly found in the western part of South Africa and Namibia (see map). The most widespread species is S. salmoniflorum, and S. vanderietiae is the species with the most easterly distribution. One species, S. mossamedense, also occurs in Angola.Species of Sarcocaulon occur in regions where dry climatic conditions prevail, and are found on rocky hillsides or mountainsides, gravel, outcrops of weathered quartzite and red dune sands. S. patersonii, for example, inhabits the extremely arid desert area between Port Nolloth and Lüderitz. Sarcocaulon comprises 14 species, divided into four main groups (sections) by Moffett (1979). This division is based primarily on the nature of the leaf margin, a feature Moffett considered to be ecologically stable in the genus. The resulting grouping appears to be natural, and further similarities within the groups are the glabrous leaves in section Sarcocaulon, the puberulous leaves and yellow flowers in section Crenatum, the undulate leaves and pink to purple flowers in section Denticulatum, and the hairy leaves in section Multifidum.",,"According to Charles Craib (1995), Sarcocaulon species are generally easy to cultivate. He says most species, with the exception of S. camdeboense and S. vanderietiae, rarely produce an extensive new root system once they have been transplanted. Transplanted specimens flower sporadically in cultivation, but survive for many years.

Seed-grown plants, in contrast, thrive and flower prolifically in cultivation. The ideal cultivation medium for most species is silt collected from the sides of road culverts, to which a small amount of bone meal and some ordinary sandy garden soil has been added. Seeds should be sown just under the surface of the soil, in large seed trays. They should be planted out into individual containers when they are about two years old.

All Sarcocaulon species require direct sunlight when in full growth. Seedlings need to be regularly watered whilst they are in active growth and occasionally during dormancy.

S. salmoniflorum has a good deal of potential for the landscaping trade. The species is easily and relatively quickly grown from seed and long lived (Craib 1995).",,,"Members of the family Geraniaceae have long been widely cultivated for their horticultural value. Members of Sarcocaulon are much sought after by succulent lovers. The fleshy branches, covered with wax, are flammable and even when wet can be used as a kindling to light fires.",,,,,
Cyrtanthus falcatus,Cyrtanthus falcatus,,"Cyrtanthus falcatus is a deciduous, summer-growing bulbous plant producing a large, pear-shaped bulb with a distinct neck. It has four arching, leathery, strap-shaped, bright green leaves and a pendent inflorescence of numerous long, narrowly trumpet-shaped flowers. The flower buds appear in mid-spring together with the new leaves. The sturdy, maroon flower stem grows rapidly to a height of up to 300 mm and is distinctly curved in the uppermost part, resembling a shepherd's crook. Due to the unusual horizontal or downward-facing position of the bulbs in habitat, the flower stem bends upwards into an erect posture. Up to ten flowers are produced per inflorescence and the flowers have long perianth tubes up to 4 cm long. The outer surface of the perianth segments is pale yellowish-green with reddish-pink margins, while the inner surface is attractively striped with brownish-maroon. The anthers are bright yellow, and the style is straight with a maroon tip. The fruit is an oblong-shaped capsule that splits longitudinally, releasing numerous black, flattened papery seeds.","Cyrtanthus falcatus was described by Dr R.A. Dyer in 1939. The genus name Cyrtanthus means curved flower, and is derived from the Greek kyrtos (curved) and anthos (flower). The species name falcatus means sickle-shaped or curved in Latin, and refers to the distinctive sickle-shaped or curved foliage.","Cyrtanthus falcatus is only known to occur in Grassland of the Drakensberg mountains in the KwaZulu-Natal midlands, South Africa, usually below 1800 m. The bulbs are found on vertical cliffs, either hanging downwards or lying in a horizontal position, with the roots securely anchored between rock slabs.",,"C. falcatus is one of the easiest species to cultivate and it is most successfully grown as a container subject. Hanging baskets, or shallow or deep, 30-35 cm diameter plastic containers are most suitable. It requires a sharply drained growing medium such as equal parts of coarse river sand and finely milled bark or finely milled compost. The bulbs are planted with the entire neck and about one third of the bulb exposed. It does best in a lightly shaded position or one receiving morning sun and afternoon shade. A thorough drench is recommended every seven to ten days from mid-spring to the end of the summer growing period, until the leaves begin to turn yellow and die back in autumn. During late autumn and throughout the winter months, the soil should preferably be kept completely dry, but the bulbs can withstand some moisture provided the soil medium is sharply drained. The bulbs are gregarious and should be allowed to form thick clumps, and left undisturbed for at least five years, until clumps become too thick and flowering performance diminishes.

Propagation of C. falcatus is easily achieved by means of offsets and seed. In order to obtain pure seed, cross-pollination by hand is necessary between different clones. The black, flat papery seeds of Cyrtanthus species have limited viability and are best sown as soon as they are ripe, in deep seed trays in the same growing medium recommended for adult bulbs. The seeds are sown just under the surface and kept moist using a fine rose. Germination takes place within three to four weeks and seedlings should remain in their seed trays for two growing seasons before being planted out into permanent containers at the beginning of their third season. First flowers can be expected from the fifth season onwards, under ideal conditions. Offsets are best removed at the end of winter, just before active growth begins. They are removed by gentle tugging, and should not be forcibly broken off as this may cause excessive damage to the basal plate. Damaged surface should be treated with a fungicide and be replanted as soon as possible to prevent desiccation of the perennial fleshy roots.",,,,,,,,
Tamarix usneoides,Tamarix usneoides,,"Tamarix usneoides is a perennial shrub or small tree 0.6-6.09 m tall; crown upright, narrow, somewhat columnar or narrowly conical; plants usually found in dense stands. Stems short, scaly. Branches leafy, usually extending from ground level; branchlets almost drooping. Bark brown-grey, rough, glabrous when older, longitudinally fissured. Leaves 1.25 mm long, greyish green, with salt glands, scale-like, vaginate (base clasping the stem or branch), closely overlapping, with short to inconspicuous herbaceous point. The plants are rarely dioecious.

Inflorescence loose to more or less densely composed of slender axillary sprays or racemes. Flowers very small, pale, cream-white; petals inequilateral, 2.25 mm long, elliptic-ovate; sepals entire, outer sepals smaller, ovate-acute, inner sepals bigger, trullate-ovate; bracts similar to leaves, vaginate, shorter than to slightly exceeding pedicels (flower stalks); pedicels half as long as sepals; corolla persistent. Flowering in summer, July to October, sometimes in January, February and May.

Fruit is a capsule, ovoid, about 6 mm long, dehiscent. Each flower can produce thousands of tiny (1mm diameter) seeds that are contained in a small capsule and are usually decorated with a tuft of hair at the apex.

T. usneoides is usually deep-rooted; tap roots are able to harvest water from deeper in the soil profile, may reach 30 m in depth; spreading adventitious roots are often produced when a plant is buried by shifting dunes and may reach a length of 50 m","Linnaeus altered the name Tamaricus of Tournefort to Tamarix, a classical Latin name for trees of the genus. ","Tamarix usneoides is distributed in the semi-desert and karoo areas of the south-western region of South Africa in the Northern Cape, Western Cape and Eastern Cape provinces, and in Namibia. It occurs along river banks, dry or temporary river beds and pans with subterranean, often brackish water, on sandy and salty dunes and flats, and in rocky deserts, at altitudes of 90-1 370 m. The genus Tamarix is native to drier parts of Africa, Asia and Europe, and consists of about 50-60 species. In South Africa the genus is represented by T. usneoides. Pure stands of T. usneoides are difficult to find because the species hybridizes with alien species. There are three alien species in southern Africa: T. chinensis, T. parviflora and T. ramosissima, which are now naturalized in the arid parts of the country. These aliens have a more rounded crown, sessile leaves and pale to dark pink flowers. The hybrid of T. usneoides and T. ramosissima occurs in Western Cape and also in Namibia. It looks more like T. ramosissima, with flowers that might look creamish but in fact have a tint of pink and, as in T. ramosissima, it has long prominent bracts and long internodes.

Many species of the genus are known to be troublesome due to their invasive habits and because they compete with neighbouring plants for water resources. Tamarix plants are xerophytic trees or shrubs. They have long tap roots that allow them to intercept deep water tables and exploit natural water resources. They are highly tolerant of various stressful conditions such as heat, cold, drought, floods, and high concentrations of dissolved solids. Tamarix is an adaptable halophytic genus, tolerant of highly saline habitats. It is able to limit competition from other plants by taking up salt from deep ground water through the roots, accumulating it in their leaves, exuding the excess concentrated salts through glands in the leaves and dropping them, causing a situation of increased surface soil salinity. By this temporal alteration of the environment it inhibits the development of native plant species. The salt is washed away from the soil surface during heavy rains.

Tamarix is fire-adapted; it has a high foliar water and salt content making it difficult to burn. Fire increases flowering and seed production. When fire does occur, Tamarix resprouts readily from its root crown and rhizomes. The seeds are contained in a small capsule and are usually adorned with a tuft of hair at the apex that aids in dispersal by wind. Seeds can also be dispersed by water.",,"Tamarix usneoides is rarely seen in gardens, while alien and hybrid Tamarix species with pink flowers are widely grown as ornamentals and sometimes mistaken for T. usneoides. The grower may recognise T. usneoides by its cream-white flowers, and vaginate, scaly leaves. Tamarix can spread both vegetatively, by adventitious roots and sexually, by seeds.

Tamarix trees are most often propagated by cuttings. Seedlings require extended periods of soil saturation for establishment. The trees can tolerate a wide range of environmental conditions once established.",,,"The leaves provide fodder to livestock. Wood is used mainly for firewood. The genus is an efficient windbreaker, excellent dune binder, used for ornamentation, serves as hedges under desert or dry conditions, or near seashores, used for fixation of river banks to prevent erosion; it is tolerant of salt spray, and known to contain high amounts of tannin.",,,,,
Hermannia hyssopifolia,Hermannia hyssopifolia,aromatic,"Hermannia hyssopifolia is an upright to rounded shrub between 0.3 and 1.2 m tall, with multiple, long, slender stems. The young stems are purple and hairy, and older stems are reddish. The small leaves, 10-20 mm, are oblong, a pale grey-green, slightly furry and toothed at the tips. Flowers appear in loose clusters at the ends of short side branches.

The flower is attractive and quite fascinating: the calyx is swollen into a small, hairy balloon, 70-10 mm, with five small, lemon-yellow petals attached at the mouth in a neat, tight circle. Flowering time is spring (August to September).

The small seeds form shortly afterwards, enclosed in the now chartaceous (papery) calyx.","There is an 18th century specimen of Hermannia hyssopifolia in the Linnean herbarium in Sweden but its exact date and the collector are not recorded. Later specimens were collected around 1830 by Franz Drège and Carl Zeyher, both important German plantsmen.

Paul Hermann was a 17th century physician and traveller and leading botanist of his day. He was still working on his collection of Cape plants when he died in 1695. Part of this collection can be found in the British Natural History Museum. His contribution to botany is commemorated in the genus Hermannia.

The species name hyssopifolia means with leaves like hyssop. The genus Hyssopus is a small group of Mediterranean and Asian aromatic herbaceous plants unrelated to the hermannias (they belong to the family Lamiaceae) which have been known since biblical times.","Although not considered threatened, in some areas the habitat of Hermannia hyssopifolia has been reduced by farming, for example in the Caldedon District where it is now mainly seen on road verges.

Hermannia hyssopifolia is endemic to the Cape Peninsula and southern Cape where it is quite common on moist or sheltered slopes and is less often found on flat ground. On the Cape Peninsula it can be found growing on Lion's Rump and on the eastern side of Table Mountain on stony granite or clay slopes. Although it prefers the wetter areas of the southern Cape, its distribution extends into the Little Karoo where it tends to be found in seeps or on moist, south-facing slopes. It also extends into the Eastern Cape where the plant shows a change in leaf form. Its natural distribution would suggest that it is unlikely to tolerate frosts.More than 90% of the approximately 200 species of Hermannia are found in southern Africa and the majority of these are in the Cape. A few other species occur in tropical Africa, Australia and Central or North America.

Hermannias were in the family Sterculiaceae but are now classified in the Malvaceae. There is a close relationship between the families Sterculiaceae, Malvaceae, Bombacaceae and Tiliaceae. Within these families, some of the characteristics that members have in common are now known to have evolved separately in different places and they are not necessarily inherited from a common ancestor. This places their status as families in doubt and the latest revision of this group (Bayer et al. 1999) redefine them as subfamilies of Malvaceae sensu lato (meaning in the broad sense).

Quite a few species of hermannias are palatable to herbivores and so in grazed veld they are not often seen in full bloom.

The pollinator of Hermannia hyssopifolia is not known but it has been suggested that it is moth pollinated. When ripe, the papery calyces fall off the plant and roll around in the wind, so dispersing the seed. The plant does not resprout after fire but relies on reseeding.",,"The following points are guidelines: it probably prefers a semi-shaded and damp or reasonably well-watered spot in the garden, and its natural distribution would suggest that it is unlikely to tolerate frosts. Cuttings can be taken from new growth in late winter to early spring (July and August). Seed can be collected in early summer (late October to November) and sown in autumn. Young plants would enjoy a light sand and loam mix with lots of compost for its water-retaining properties. The full-grown plant would probably respond to pruning back lightly after flowering but it should not be cut back hard.

It is a medium-sized shrub and, as it is quite upright, it would best be incorporated into an herbaceous border or bed, grouped with other plants that enjoy some moisture and light shade, such as Aristea ecklonii, Eucomis autumnalis, Thunbergia natalensis, Freylinia tropica, Hibiscus calyphyllus and Justicia campylostemon.",,,"Hermannia hyssopifolia is one of a number of aromatic shrubby plants known as agtdaegeneesbossie, meaning eight-day healing bush, as they are supposed to cure within eight days. Some other species of Hermannia have the name pleisterbos, meaning healing-plaster bush, also indicating medicinal properties. The Xhosa combined H. hyssopifolia with other plant extracts to make an ointment for erysipelas (a common skin infection) and the remedy remained in use in the Cape into the 20th century; it was also taken in the form of a tea as a blood purifier or as a remedy for syphilis.",,,,,
Salvia africana-caerulea,Salvia africana-caerulea,,"Salvia africana-caerulea is a soft, greyish, hairy, much-branched shrub up to 2 m tall. The leaves are greenish on the upper surface, covered with grey hairs and dotted with glands on the lower surface, strongly aromatic, simple, opposite, obovate (egg-shaped but broader towards the tip) and sometimes toothed.

Flowers are produced from midwinter to midsummer (June to January) peaking in spring to early summer (Aug.-Dec.), in whorls, crowded at the tips of the stems. The corolla is two-lipped, the lips roughly equal in length; the upper lip is blue to bluish-purple or pinkish and hooded; the lower one is usually white in the centre with darker spots, and is turned down at the edge, giving the impression of a gaping mouth.

The style is long, slender and curved, and sticks out beyond the hooded upper lip. The stamens are strangely shaped. The filament of each stamen is attached to one side of the lower part of the corolla tube. A cross-piece that is hinged so that it can move up and down is attached at the top end of the filament. This cross-piece carries the anther at one end and a 'pedal' at the other.

The 'pedal' is in fact the other half of the anther, transformed into a structure that a visiting bee has to press on as it probes for nectar, causing the hinged anther to move down and deposit pollen on the back of the bee. The calyx is funnel-shaped, dotted with glands and covered in long, silky grey hairs, green with pinkish purple tips. It persists long after the flower has dropped and enlarges at the fruiting stage, becoming thin, light and papery by the time the seeds are mature.

The fruit consists of four 1-seeded, small, rounded nutlets that are formed at the base of the flower, inside the calyx. They remain attached at the base of the calyx after the flower drops, falling out when mature.","Salvia comes from the Latin, salvere, meaning to save or heal, referring to the healing properties of these plants. The species name, africana, means of or from Africa, and caerulea means blue.

Salvia africana-caerulea was one of the first plants to be used medicinally by the Dutch at the Cape, who used it instead of sage, Salvia officinalis, which has been used and esteemed as a medicinal plant, applied for all ills, at least since the days of ancient Greece and Rome. The reputation of our Salvia as a medicinal plant may be why it was cultivated in the Amsterdam medical garden by about 1710 and in the Chelsea Physic Garden by about 1760.","Salvia africana-caerulea is found on sandy slopes and flats from Namaqualand in the Northern Cape to the Cape Peninsula and Caledon in the Western Cape. It grows in fynbos. Salvia africana-caerulea is pollinated by bees and the flower is adapted to assist in pollination-see the description above to recap the structure of the flower. The bottom petal is a platform for the bee to land on. As it probes for nectar, it presses against the ‘pedal’, which causes the hinged anthers to move down and deposit pollen on the back of the bee, while the curved stigma collects pollen that it has already picked up from other flowers it visited previously.

The hooded upper petal protects the anthers, e.g. from rain and dew. By the time the seeds are ripe, the calyx is dry, papery and light, assisting in the dispersal of the seeds by being easily blown about by the wind.",,"Salvia africana-caerulea is easy to grow and a rewarding garden shrub, adding texture, contrast and colour to the garden. Grow it in full sun in well-drained soil. Water well until it is established but take care not to over-water, as, like most sages, it does not like to be waterlogged. Cut back after flowering to keep it neat and vigorous, and it will bloom nearly all year round. It can be grown in low rainfall areas and is a good choice for the water-wise and fynbos garden and is a must for the herb garden. It tolerates frost (-1 to -5 o C/20 to 30 o F) and does well on the Highveld.

Propagate Salvia africana-caerulea by seed or cuttings. Cuttings give the best results. Cuttings from new growth near the base of the plant taken in spring or early summer root very easily. The newly rooted plants respond well to regular feeding with an organic fertilizer.

Seed can be sown in autumn or spring to early summer. Use well-drained soil and keep moist. As soon as the seedlings are strong enough to handle, transfer them to a single pot. After a few more weeks they are ready for planting into the garden. The seedlings respond well to organic fertilizer and pinching the tips will encourage bushy, vigorous growth and more flowers.",,,"Many African salvias, including Salvia africana-caerulea have long been used by the people of Africa as medicinal plants and to flavour food. A remedy made by mixing S. africana-caerulea tea with Epsom salts and lemon juice was used by the early settlers in South Africa to treat stomach troubles, including colic, diarrhoea, flatulence, heartburn, gripes and indigestion. It was also given to cows after calving to help in the expulsion of the placenta. The Khoisan people used S. africana-caerulea to treat coughs, colds and women's ailments. The leaves, mixed with those of Ballota africana (kattekruie) were also used to treat fevers and measles. Margaret Roberts recipe for sage tea is to pour one cup of boiling water over one tablespoon of fresh leaves, allow to draw for 5 minutes, sweeten with honey and add a slice of lemon for taste. To ease a cough, including whooping cough, sip a little frequently. To treat colds, flu and chest ailments and for painful or excessive menstruation, drink half a cup four times a day.

The tea is also an excellent gargle for sore throats and night coughing. Even chewing a fresh leaf will ease a sore throat and help restore a lost voice. This tea can also be used externally as a mildly antiseptic wash. A stronger brew using one tablespoon of fresh leaves chopped into one tablespoon of honey and two tablespoons of lemon juice makes a soothing cough mixture for a persistent cough: take one tablespoon every half hour until the cough eases.

Salvia africana-caerulea is an excellent substitute for the ordinary cultivated sage, Salvia officinalis.",,,,,
Honey euryops,Euryops virgineus,sweetly scented,"The honey euryops is a much-branched, evergreen shrub of up to 3.5 x 1.5 m. The branches are mostly straight, densely leafy in the upper parts, but bare lower down and rough because of the leaf scars. The leaves are dark green, small, 5-12 x 2-7 mm, palmate (like a hand with webbed fingers) or fan-shaped, with 3 to 7 lobes arranged alternately or spirally on the branches. Masses of small, bright yellow, honey-scented daisy flowerheads, 8-10 mm in diameter, consisting of both ray and disc florets, are produced terminally from late winter to spring (July-September), making it a conspicuous sight from afar. Each flowerhead consists of an outer row of 'petals' which are the ray florets. The disc florets are in the centre of the flowerhead, and are fused into tubes and resemble the stamens of other flowering plants. The flowers last well in a vase and will brighten a dull, cold winter's day! The fruits (cypselas) are small, 1.8-2.5 mm long, oblong, slightly angled, smooth and shiny yellow or light brown. They are topped with a tuft of short, white hairs (pappus hairs) which is soon lost.","The species name virgineus comes from the Latin word virgo meaning virgin, untouched - certainly descriptive of the plant in full flower growing in its natural habitat.","Euryops virgineus is endemic to southern Africa and occurs naturally in the southern coastal areas from Bredasdorp in Western Cape to Alexandria in Eastern Cape, often at low altitudes. It extends inland into the Swartberg Mountains, up to about 1 200 m. It is found in fynbos on mountain sides, sandy hill slopes, roadsides and sometimes on limestone. It also grows in karroid scrub and in grassland.",,"The honey euryops is very showy when in full flower. It needs full sun and moderate water. It is evergreen, frost-hardy and drought- and wind-resistant when established. However, it is advisable to water the plants during winter in the summer rainfall areas. They like some spray on the leaves in the dry winter atmosphere. It is fast-growing and therefore perfect for new gardens, where it rapidly fills empty spaces. Plant it at the back of a flower bed or as a hedge. Prune the plants back hard after flowering to keep them tidy. You may have to replace old plants after a few years when they have become too leggy and untidy. Propagate from seed or cuttings, but cuttings will grow faster and flower sooner.",,,,,,,,
Basal rosette ,Drosera pauciflora,,"The basal rosette of this herbaceous, insectivorous plant is compact and made up of slender leaves up to 25 mm long and 8 mm wide. The leaves are narrowly egg-shaped with the narrowest point at the base. Leaf stalks and stipules are absent. The leaves bear both knob-ended and straight tentacles.

The erect, leafless flowering stem which arises from the centre of the rosette, up to 200 mm high, bears 1-3 large pink to mauve flowers with fringed styles in spring, and flowers profusely after fire.

","The genus Drosera was named by Linnaeus in 1753, and consists of ± 126 species of which 23 occur in South Africa. Drosera gets its name from the Greek word, droseros, meaning dewy. The specific name pauciflora, meaning few-flowered, gets its origin from the Latin words paucus meaning few and flora for flowered.Synonymy includes Drosera acaulis sensu Raym.-Hamet and Drosera grandiflora Bartl.","Drosera pauciflora is endemic to South Africa and is only found in the Western Cape. The species is common in Darling, Paarl and Stellenbosch and can also be found near Piketberg. It occurs at altitudes from 61-1050 m.","Their stalks end in a bulbous head in which the glandular cells occur. These glands secrete a glistening, sticky, clear fluid used to trap and retain prey. There is speculation that the fluid is slightly sweetly scented to attract insects. The fluid contains a weak acid and enzymes that digest the soft parts of the prey. ","A very well drained sandy soil is the best growth medium; 2 parts sand or silica grit : 1 part peat or sphagnum moss, in 90-150 mm pots are ideal. It is important not to over-pot plants. Taller rather than wider pots are ideal for Drosera to thrive and to accommodate their few, but long roots.

Place the potted plants in a shallow saucer filled with fresh water to keep them moist at all times during their growth season.The author has had the best success growing this species without saucers, but watering every other day. Drosera pauciflora roots are prone to rotting if they are water-logged. If using the saucer method, allow the saucer to dry out occasionally so that the medium can aerate. This will not harm your plants so long as the moisture content in the medium is still high.

Place in a northern or eastern direction for best sunlight if growing indoors. Grow in full sun to light shade outdoors. During the plants' dormant period in summer, remove pots from water trays, but do not allow soil to dry completely. The author allows for very minimal, light watering over the dormant phase. This technique has successfully kept plants alive over their dormant period and allowed mature plants to resprout in the following winter. Other growers recommend removing roots and tubers and keeping them in a sealed container in a cool environment.

Sundews are easily propagated by seed. Prepare a 90 mm pot with growth medium; water well. In autumn sow fresh seeds on the surface of moist growth medium. Do not cover with growth medium. Place in a semi-shady position, and seeds should germinate in 2-4 weeks.

Once young leaves develop, pierce the plastic to allow for acclimatization and hardening off. Acidic or epiphytic foliar feed may be used at ¼ recommended strength once a month.

Ironically, the carnivorous plants are attacked by insect pests. Aphids, mealy bug and thrips cause deformity in new growth. Treat with a diluted pesticide or remove pests by hand. Never use a soap-based insecticide. Drying out can cause drooping and the decrease in mucilage production. Watering and keeping the plant moist will revive them. Dew production may stop after transplanting or if the leaves come into contact with inquisitive hands. New foliage will, however, grow and continue to produce dew.","Probably the most interesting characteristic of this plant is its ability to digest the nutrients it requires, especially the nitrogen, from insects caught in its stalked tentacles. Different types of glandular growths include marginal tentacles situated near the lamina margins, discal tentacles which are shorter and disc-like, usually on the upper leaf surfaces, digestive glands filled with red fluid and glandular hair-like growths on the inflorescence. The tentacles are sensitive and mobile. Their stalks end in a bulbous head in which the glandular cells occur. These glands secrete a glistening, sticky, clear fluid used to trap and retain prey. There is speculation that the fluid is slightly sweetly scented to attract insects. The fluid contains a weak acid and enzymes that digest the soft parts of the prey. The sensitive tentacles are able to detect caught prey and produce more dew to entrap their victim. Neighbouring tentacles then mobilize and slowly lean over to engulf the hapless victim. The lamina itself may also fold over to enclose or suffocate larger prey and allow for better absorption. As sensitive as these tentacles are, they are able to distinguish between a meal and other stimuli, the leaf and tentacles do not, for example, respond to water droplets.",,"Drosera species have also been recorded for use against various ailments. Extracts of the leaves were used externally for warts, corns and sunburn. Disorders such as tuberculosis, asthma, coughs, eye and ear infection, liver pain, morning sickness, stomach conditions, syphilis, toothache and intestinal problems were treated internally with teas or extracts made from the leaves. The tea was also used as a tranquilizer, and some believe that it has aphrodisiac properties. Antispasmodic agents have been found by scientists in some Drosera species.",,,,,
Astroloba cremnophila,Astroloba cremnophila,,"Astroloba cremnophila is a slow-growing, long-lived, succulent perennial, forming small, dense clusters, branching from the base, up to about 400 mm in diameter and consisting of about 12–60 heads, mainly pendent from cliff faces. The branches are 50–200 mm long; the leafy stems about 35–38 mm in diameter, glaucous green, becoming reddish green during the dry periods. Leaves are ascending, erect, in 5, spirally twisted rows, densely arranged, like tiles on a roof; triangular to egg-shaped, firm, 22–25 × 12–15 mm, with a distinct marginiform keel, apex acute to acuminate, minutely denticulate-tuberculate; margin leathery, with small saw-edged teeth (serrulate). Adaxial surface somewhat channeled, faintly striate; abaxial surface tuberculate; tubercles greenish white.

Inflorescence a simple raceme, 120–460 mm long; scape 2.0–2.5 mm wide at the base, with raceme in upper half to one third. Bracts membranous; lower bracts up to 5 mm long, triangular-acuminate, whitish translucent; floral bracts 2.5–3.0 mm long, translucent with darker median stripe. Flowers 3–10 mm apart, sub-secundly arranged, ascending spreading. Pedicel 3 mm long. Flowers tubular, 11 × 2.5 mm; lobes fused into a tube, slightly curved, free for 1.5 mm, grey-green, with white stripes; outer lobes spreading, apices truncate to emarginate; inner lobes obtuse, curved inwards. Stamens 8–9 mm long, anthers 5 mm long. Ovary oblong, 3.5 × 1.5–2.0 mm, green, styles 3 mm long, stigma minute, white, capitate. Capsule linear ovoid 7 × 3 mm. Seeds not seen. Flowering time is in summer, from November to April.

","The generic name Astroloba, meaning 'star lobe', is from the Greek astro, meaning ‘star-like’ or ‘star-shaped’, and lobos, meaning ‘lobe’, and pertains to its flowers. The specific epithet cremnophila, meaning ‘cliff-loving’, is from the Greek cremnos, meaning ‘cliff or crag’ and philos, meaning ‘loving or fond’, pertaining to its cliff face habitat.

Astroloba cremnophila was named by the author in the British Cactus & Succulent Journal, Bradleya, in 2015 (Van Jaarsveld 2015). It has been known for several years and grown at Kirstenbosch National Botanical Garden.","The Red List status of this recently described species has not yet been evaluated, but in the author’s opinion it is not threatened, as it is protected by its sheer cliff-face habitat, which makes them difficult to reach.

Astroloba cremnophila is only known from from the cliffs at Buffelspoort along the Buffels River, tributary to the Gouritz River, in the Western Cape. The Buffelspoort is part of the western portion of the Groot Swartberg. It is locally common and well protected by its cliff face habitat (most aspects), growing at altitudes of 600–800 m above sea level. The vegetation consists of Gamka Thicket and part of the thicket vegetation (Mucina 2006). Plants grow in mineral-poor sandstone cliffs. Associated plants include Albuca buffelspoortensis, Portulacaria afra, Crassula arborescens, C. cultrata, C. perforata, C. rupestris subsp. rupestris and C. orbicularis, Drimia convallarioides (= Rhadamanthus montanus) and Senecio citriformis. The climate is dry, without frost. Temperatures during summer can be very high, with an average daily maximum of about 25–26°C, the average daily minimum about 10°C. Rainfall occurs during summer and winter and rains range from 200–300 mm per annum. It is one of 8 species of Astroloba, all are endemic to South Africa, and all are succulent and popular in cultivation. Astroloba is part of the Asphodelaceae and is closely related to Aloe, Haworthia, Gasteria, Tulista and Haworthiopsis. They are easily distinguished by their short, leathery, firm, succulent leaves ending in a hard point and star-lobed flowers.

The tubular, pale whitish flowers are pollinated by local insects. After fertilization the capsules mature and become erect, opening from the end and the fine seeds dispersed by wind.",,"Astroloba cremnophila can be grown in containers and rockeries, however, is best cultivated in clay pots in a greenhouse under controlled conditions. Best in bright light conditions, however plants will tolerate some shade. For outdooor cultivation it is best cultivated in Thicket and Succulent Karoo Gardens (Van Jaarsveld 2010), or similarly, dry Mediterranean-type gardens in other parts of the world, where frost is not too severe. Plants prefer full sun to partial shade. It is a slow grower, eventually forming a small cluster. Flowering size can be reached in about 3 to 5 years. Best to feed plants with an organic fertilizer such as compost or any other liquid fertilizer. Astroloba cremnophila can be watered at any time of the year, however, watering should be reduced in winter.

This species can by propagated by stem cuttings or seed.

Astroloba cremnophila is easily propagated from stem cuttings, but can take several weeks to root and is best undertaken in spring or summer. Cuttings are best rooted in a small container in a well-drained medium such as sand. Sow seed preferably in spring or summer in a shady position in a sandy slightly acidic soil. Cover with a thin layer of sand and keep moist.",,,,,,,,
Pachycarpus natalensis,Pachycarpus natalensis,,"Perennial, geophytic herb with 1 or 2 stems, which are 300–520 mm long, usually resprouting after winter (or fire) annually. The rootstock is tuberous and at least as long as the stems. The leaves are spreading-erect, lance-shaped to broadly ovate, 42–77 × 23–47 mm; the apex is obtuse, acute or acuminate, or mucronate; the base cuneate/attenuate or rounded. The midrib and secondary veins on the leaves are prominent.

The petiole is 4.0–13.2 mm long. Stalkless inflorescences carry 2–5 flowers in an umbel. The corolla of the flower is saucer-shaped, horizontally spreading and the corolla lobes are green or greenish yellow, with deep purple blotches.

The tips of the corolla are slightly reflexed, lobes free for most of their length, 11–17 × 5–12 mm. The gynostegial column, anther wings and anther appendages are completely hidden by the purple, broadly-ovate coronal blades, which are curved above the style apex. The staminal column is stipitate. The corona lobes are maroon-purple with complicate-spathulate lobes that are 5–7 mm high, basal proximal lobe 3–5 mm long, with 2, erect wings, distal appendage dilated, deltoid in shape, 7–8 mm long, inflexed to enclose style-stigma-head. In fruit, the pedicels are characteristically twisted, with the follicles ellipsoid, 95–100 × 25 mm, glabrous and 6-winged.

The seeds are 6–7 mm long, bi-facially flattened, with the one side convex, the other concave. Plants flower from October to February, but mostly in mid-summer. In drier years, plants tend to be smaller and in wetter years, they are larger in all aspects.","The generic name is derived from the Greek words pachys, ‘thick’ and karpos, ‘a fruit’, in reference to the enlarged large fruits that most species in this genus develop. The epithet natalensis, is in reference to the geographical distribution of the taxon when first described. At the time N.E. Brown described this taxon all the specimens available to him came from Natal, now KwaZulu-Natal, and hence he used this as the specific epithet.","Despite the relatively restricted distribution of P. natalensis, this taxon was not selected in any of the screening processes for highlighting potential taxa of conservation concern in order for detailed conservation assessment to be done and as such, has been given an automated national threat status of Least Concern (LC).

Pachycarpus natalensis is a South African endemic species found in KwaZulu-Natal and the Eastern Cape. Plants are found widespread in midland and upland grasslands, frequently in rocky areas, at altitudes from 600–1 200 m. The map shows herbarium specimens located in the National Herbarium in Pretoria (PRE) only.The genus Pachycarpus consists of about 27 taxa of which most are found in southern Africa, but some members also extend to tropical Africa. The only other member of this genus that has been covered in this series, is P. schinzianus. The corona lobes of P. natalensis are very similar to those in P. reflectens illustrated here. The 2 species are further distinguished from each other in that P. natalensis has the corona lobes flat or spreading and broad leaves, compared to P. reflectens having narrower leaves and corolla lobes that are reflexed straight back, so that they almost lie parallel with the petiole. The distribution and flowering time between these 2 species are also further used to distinguish them.

In a study by Olleron et al. (2003), P. natalensis is pollinated exclusively by male and female spider-hunting wasps (Hemipepsis hilaris). This per se does not mean it is the only pollinator, and further studies are needed. They have also shown that although there is a contrast in reflectance between the corona lobes and corolla of the flowers, pollinators probably are rather attracted to the nectar and/or scent, rather than colour of the flowers. The packets of pollen known as pollinaria, are specifically placed on the mouthparts of these wasps, which carry it to the next flower for pollination. Nectar is secreted by the corona lobes where they fold together to form a groove and runs down the guide rails (this is where pollinia have to be deposited for pollination to take place). This is the so-called specialized pompilid wasp pollination and is shared with other asclepiads, including Miraglossum pilosum and M. verticillare.",,"To my knowledge this plant is not cultivated, but would be best suited in its natural range in rocky gardens. As the plants develop deep tuberous rootstocks, it would ideally be suited to plant in the ground directly and would probably fare better than as a potted specimen.",,,"The Natal thick-fruit is used in traditional medicine to treat stomach complaints and as an infusion sprinkled on eggs to prevent dogs from eating them (it makes them violently ill). Most Pachycarpus species have bitter-tasting rootstocks and are used in the same way as uzara (Xysmalobium undulatum) for diarrhoea and colic, but also for treatment of stomach cramps, headache, oedema (as a diuretic) (Van Wyk & Wink 2004).

Many species of Pachycarpus and without doubt P. natalensis too, are rubbed on animal skins and let to dry out, in order to repel dogs whilst the hide is drying and to be used for other purposes. Tubers are used especially by the Xhosa for various stomach ailments.",,,,,
Asparagus ramosissimus,Asparagus ramosissimus,,"Asparagus ramossisimus is a soft-textured, mounding or cascading shrub, 1.0–2.2 m high. The stems are weak and scrambling or climbing, slightly zig-zagging, up to about 1 m long, with fine, feathery, light green foliage, and no spines. Asparagus plants do not possess true leaves. What appear to be small, needle-like leaves, are actually modified flattened stems called cladodes. In this species, the cladodes are flattened and linear (long and narrow in shape), 5–15 mm long, and are produced in threes. It flowers in summer; the flowers are small, 3 mm long and 8 mm wide, white, nodding with spreading tepals. They are produced singly in the axils. The flowers are followed by orange-red, spherical berries, about 10 mm in diameter.","The genus Asparagus derives its name from the Greek word Asparagos, the name given to the edible cultivated asparagus. This species is named for its many branches, ramosissimus meaning ‘branching the most’ from the Latin, ramosus = ‘branched’ and ‘issimus’, being the superlative. This plant was previously known as Myrsiphyllum ramossisimum (Baker) Oberm.","The current conservation status of Asparagus ramossisimus is LC (Least Concern), meaning that this species is not threatened.

Asparagus ramosissimus is found growing in moist, shady places, from Potberg in the Western Cape, through the Eastern Cape, Free State, Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal to Limpopo and Mpumalanga; also in Swaziland and Lesotho. The genus Asparagus consists of approximately 200 species in Africa, Asia and Europe with 88 in southern Africa. They are shrubs or scramblers and climbers with perennial or annual stems from a compact woody base. Their roots are often tuberous and edible, and their leaves are reduced to scales; they are often spiny. What look like the leaves are in fact modified stems called cladodes. The flowers are small, white and often strongly fragrant. The fruit is a berry. The best known members of this genus are: Asparagus officinalis, the asparagus that is commonly cultivated and eaten, and Asparagus plumosus, the ‘asparagus fern’, used by florists. In South Africa, the most commonly cultivated ornamental species is Asparagus densiflorus, known as asparagus fern, emerald fern or basket asparagus.",,"Asparagus plants are mostly used for their decorative foliage, although some species have attractive flowers and showy berries. This species looks good cascading over retaining walls and in rockeries, adding a leafy luxuriance to the planting. It will thrive in dappled shade, or in partial to full shade, and is suitable for shady gardens, as well as in containers and hanging baskets on shady patios and indoors. It can be mass planted as a ground cover. It prefers a moist, well-drained, loamy soil, and can tolerate cold temperatures to -7ºC. It is relatively drought resistant and can also take large amounts of water. Mites have been found to be the pests to watch out for when growing this species. Chemical sprays can be used to control the mites, but a more ecologically friendly approach can also be attempted, by introducing natural enemies, like ladybird beetles.

Asparagus ramossisimus is best propagated from seed. The thin fleshy coating of the fruit must be removed and the seeds sown fresh for best results. Sow in spring or summer, using a general well-drained, sterile sowing medium. Cover the seeds lightly and water well. Keep in a controlled environment that is warm and lightly shaded, and do not allow the soil to dry out. Prick out and pot up the seedlings when they are large enough to handle. Use a compost-enriched loamy medium. Grow the young plants on in light shade and keep well watered. Feed regularly for lush growth. Although established plants can also be propagated by division, it does not yield good results (Anthony Hitchcock 2015, pers. comm.)",,,"Asparagus ramosissimus roots are sometimes eaten in KwaZulu-Natal and Swaziland. This plant is used in traditional medicine in KwaZulu-Natal and Swaziland to treat colic and as a protective charm against snakes. It is also used to make love charms. In Lesotho roots are used to treat stomach pain and colic, and to cure a rash caused by seeing a snake, and as a charm to make herds prosper.",,,,,
Moraea insolens,Moraea insolens,sweetly-scented,"This deciduous, winter-growing geophyte grows 200–350 mm high and has a small, rounded corm, protected by a covering of hard, light brown outer tunics. The corm produces two, dark brown, basal sheaths and has a solitary, linear, bright green, channelled leaf. The slender flower stem has prominent nodes and is sometimes branched, producing a succession of salver-shaped flowers, each lasting three days, from between two spathe bracts. The tepals vary in shades of light to bright orange-red and are rarely white or cream-coloured.

The three outer tepals are larger than the three inner ones and all are adorned with a deep brown, arrow-shaped marking near the base, sometimes outlined in white. The filaments are united into a central column with three long anthers symmetrically arranged opposite the three outer tepals. The anthers produce sticky, bright orange pollen. The fruit is an elliptic capsule containing many small, light brown, irregularly shaped seeds. The plant flowers from mid- to late spring (mid-September to mid-October) and is completely dormant in summer. M. insolens is a very distinctive species in flower, not easily mistaken for any other member of the genus.","Philip Miller, the Scottish horticulturist and botanist, established the genus Morea in 1758, in tribute to the English horticulturist Robert More of Shropshire. Carolus Linnaeus later altered the spelling of the genus name to Moraea, in order to associate it with his father-in-law, the Swedish physician Dr Johan Moraeus. The specific name insolens, is descriptive of the radiant, glowing tepal colour of the orange-red forms. The species was first documented in the 1820s by the European botanical collectors, C.F. Ecklon and C.L. & Zeyher, who recorded it at two localities near Caledon. It was initially described as Homeria maculata by the German botanist F.W. Klatt in volume 34 of Linnaea in 1866. The plant appears not to have been recorded again until the early 20th century, when it was displayed at the Caledon Wild Flower Show in 1912 and 1931. A cream-coloured form was collected and painted in 1921 by Louise Guthrie at the Bolus Herbarium, from a locality just west of Caledon. Decades later, the English anthropologist and Iridaceae enthusiast Thomas T. Barnard, discovered a population of orange-red plants east of Caledon in 1968 and the species was described as Moraea insolens by Peter Goldblatt in volume 41 of The Flowering Plants of Africa in 1971, illustrated with a watercolour plate by Margo Branch. Occurring on a small piece of state-owned land, comprising just a few hectares, a protective perimeter fence was erected around this population and for many years, local volunteer conservationists have attempted to keep encroaching alien vegetation under control. In 2007, a small new population comprising some 50 individuals, was discovered within a private nature reserve to the northeast of Stanford. Plants from east of Caledon have been in continuous cultivation at Kirstenbosch, since 1982.","According to the Red List of South African Plants, consulted on 26 July 2016, Moraea insolens is assessed as Critically Endangered (CR). This is due mainly to massive habitat loss from expanding wheat fields and smothering overgrowth by alien plants. Furthermore, the plants fail to flower and set seed if the habitat is not burnt or cleared frequently enough. One subpopulation is protected within a private nature reserve near Stanford. Another to the east of Caledon, is surrounded by a fence in a state of disrepair and is threatened by alien vegetation, and another immediately west of this town, may be close to extinction, due to habitat disturbance. Wild-collected seeds of this species are in long-term cold storage in the Millenium Seed Bank at Wakehurst Place in the United Kingdom. Comprising well over 200 species of winter-growing, summer-growing and evergreen cormous plants, Moraea is native to sub-Saharan Africa, the Mediterranean basin and the Middle East, and its centre of diversity is in the southwestern part of the Western Cape. The species vary from delicate, slender plants with exceptionally narrow, deciduous leaves, such as Moraea worcesterensis, to robust ones with leathery, relatively broad, evergreen leaves, like those of M. alticola and M. spathulata. The M. villosa (peacock moraea) from the Western Cape, is one of the most admired species. The most well-known member in ornamental horticulture is probably the frost-hardy, evergreen M. huttonii, a yellow-flowered, sweetly-scented species found from the Eastern Cape to Mpumalanga. Numerous species including M. aristata, M. gigandra, M. loubseri and M. tulbaghensis are threatened in the wild, due mainly to habitat loss. The corms of M. fugax (soetuintjie) can be eaten raw and are known to have been consumed by Cape hunter-gatherer peoples. The genus also contains several, very poisonous, weedy species, such as M. miniata (pronktulp) and M. polystachya (bloutulp), which are problematic to stock farmers in South Africa and have become invasive in parts of Australia. 

Historically, Moraea insolens has always had a restricted distribution in the western part of the southern Cape and it is currently known from three, severely fragmented subpopulations, with much-depleted gene pools. Two of these are located below the Swartberg, near Caledon, the third to an area near the Klein Rivier Mountains, northeast of Stanford. The species is a narrow endemic of fertile, pebbly clay slopes in Western Rûens Shale Renosterveld, a vegetation type with exceptionally high levels of geophyte diversity. The plants occur as scattered individuals or in small clumps in open aspects, in soil which may become inundated for short periods, following heavy rain. In at least one site, it grows in association with the endangered, evergreen, blue- or lilac-flowered Aristea biflora. The species is suited to cultivation in containers in low humidity, frost-free environments. Due to their deciduous nature and requirement of a dry, dormant period in most species, the deciduous moraeas are generally unsuited to general garden cultivation and best grown in containers.",,"Moraea insolens is a delicate species. It is not too difficult to grow in containers, but is wholly unsuited to general cultivation in garden beds and rockeries that are irrigated in summer, as it requires a dry, summer-dormant period, and its corms would certainly be taken by molerats and porcupines. Plastic pots 25–30 cm in diameter, are recommended, placed in a position receiving full morning sun and afternoon shade. It requires protection from heavy winter rain, such as is experienced in the southern suburbs of Cape Town; is frost-sensitive, and must have a completely dry summer dormant period. Although it occurs naturally in stony clay soils in the wild, it readily adapts to well-drained, acid, sandy media in cultivation. A suggested mixture is equal parts of coarse silica sand and finely sifted compost, with the addition of a 5 cm layer of compost placed in the base of the pot. Plant the corms in late autumn, about 3 cm deep, and give an initial heavy watering. Once the leaf shoots appear, water heavily about twice per week throughout the winter months. This species flowers at the end of the growing season and it is important for the plants to be well-watered throughout spring, in order for the developing flower spikes to remain strong and not abort. Once the leaves begin to turn brown in late spring, withhold watering altogether for the duration of summer. Mature corms tend to become moribund when cultivated over periods of many years, however, lifting the corms and replanting them into new soil every 3–5 years, certainly assists in moderating this tendency.

The corms do not readily produce offsets, and in order to maintain this species in cultivation, it is essential to continually propagate it from seed. Hand-pollination and isolation from other species of Moraea is essential to obtain pure seeds that will flower true-to-type. Sow the seeds in autumn in the same medium recommended for adult corms. If sown fresh, seeds will germinate within 4 weeks and in ideal conditions, seedlings can be expected to flower in the third or fourth year.

The developing flower buds are susceptible to infestation by aphids, and the leaf lower surfaces may become infested with red spider mites when grown in enclosed, poorly ventilated conditions. The corms are not usually susceptible to attack by mealy bug, but fungal rotting will take place if not kept dry in summer.",,,,,,,,
Combretum apiculatum subsp. apiculatum,Combretum apiculatum subsp. apiculatum,,"This is a single- or multi-stemmed small tree 3-10 m high, with a short, often curved trunk, and spreading irregular canopy. The long slender branches hang low down, giving the tree a willow-like appearance. It grows in higher rainfall regions. The bark on the main stem is grey to dark grey or brownish grey and smooth becoming scaly and rough with age.

The simple leaves have sharp, twisted tips, hence the specific epithet; they are shiny yellow-green in colour, alternate, opposite or in whorls of three at the nodes, with blades narrowly to broadly elliptic, oblong or broadly obovate. The base is roundish in outline. Young leaves are sticky.

Flowers occur in axils on new shoots, 3-4 on each shoot. Petals are yellow to creamy green and strongly scented. It flowers from September to February. The fruit is four-winged, 20-30 x 15-25 mm, almost round to ovoid, with wings up to 7 mm wide, glutinous when young, yellowish-green, often tinged with red. It has a single seed in the centre. It fruits from January to May. Fruits often stay on the tree until the next flowers appear in August.

Subsp. leutweinii from Namibia differs in having hairier leaves. It occurs mainly in Mopane veld.",Combretum is a Latin name referring to a climbing plant while the term apiculatum refers to the sharp tip of the leaf. Many of the Combretum species are climbers although this species is not.,"Red bushwillow is a widespread species in Africa, growing from KwaZulu-Natal and Mpumalanga and Limpopo (South Africa) to Botswana, Mozambique, Namibia, Zimbabwe and other parts of tropical Africa. It occurs in various savanna conditions under medium rainfall to semi arid conditions, at low altitude up to 1400 or 1500 m. It can grow on granitic and rhyolitic soils as well as in rocky places on basalt plains, especially in Mopane woodlands.",,"This is an attractive garden tree, with brownish red or golden yellow autumn colours and it grows into a lovely shade tree. An established tree is frost- and drought-resistant. It can be grown from seed and is slow-growing. It prefers sandy soil or rocky areas with clay soil.",,,"The red bush willow is a valuable fodder tree for browsing animals; mature green leaves are eaten by kudu, bushbuck, eland, giraffe and elephant. Cattle like the leaves when they are about to fall or have fallen, especially when they are least nutritious. It is considered as an indicator of mixed veld, good for spring- and summer grazing by most farmers but needs careful management. Its fruit pose a threat to livestock, especially the seeds which are poisonous but eaten by brown-headed parrots.The wood is very hard, making it resistant to both borers and termites; it provides useful fencing poles and makes good firewood but as the pieces are not large, they can only be used to make small items of furniture. The bark is used for tanning leather. Medicinally, a decoction of the leaves has been used as a steam bath and as an enema to relieve stomach disorders. As treatment for conjunctivitis, an ash from the burnt stem is mixed with white clay and water and the resulting paste is spread over the face.",,,,,
Aloe microstigma,Aloe microstigma,,"These plants reach a height of about 600 mm and usually occur singularly or in small groups. The leaves are arranged in rosettes and are blue-green but can turn reddish brown if suffering from environmental stress. Conspicuous white spots appear on the leaves, which contrast well with the reddish teeth along the margins. The plant usually produces two or three flowers simultaneously in early winter, from May to July. The inflorescences (stem on which all flowers are borne) are up to 1m. The flowers are bicoloured, with red buds turning orange. In some places, however, the buds and open flowers may be uniformly red or yellow.","The scientific name accurately describes the distinguishing feature of the plant, microstigma means 'very small spot'.","Aloe microstigma is not threatened.

Aloe microstigma is very common and widely distributed in the dry interior of the Northern, Western and Eastern Cape Provinces and southern Namibia. It is found in a wide variety of habitats, in flat open areas, steep rocky slopes, or amongst bushes. Plants do exceptionally well in cultivation and prefer dry gardens. One can also grow them in very wet gardens, if drainage is good. Plants are drought tolerant, but the flowers are easily damaged by frost. There are about 350 species of Aloe, found in Africa, Arabia, Madagascar and Socotra. About 126 of these occur in South Africa. Aloes were traditionally grouped with other lily-like plants under the family Liliaceae. Some of their close relatives are Gasteria, Haworthia, Knophofia, Bulbinella, Bulbine, Astroloba, and Trachyandra.

Aloe microstigma is pollinated primarily by sunbirds particularly the Lesser Double-collard Sunbird, which extracts the nectar produced by the flowers. Insects may also be responsible for pollination. Seeds are produced in abundance and this serves as a survival mechanism. They are small, black to 2 mm in diameter, inconspicuously winged and wind dispersed. Seeds are parasitized by small day flies that lay their eggs in the seeds, their larvae then live off the seeds. The success of germination is relatively high giving rise to the abundance of the species.

The rosette of leaves helps to cool the plant in that the upper leaves provides shading for the lower ones. Another interesting adaptation is the inward folding of leaves during the hot summer months. This helps to protect the softer and younger leaves from extreme temperatures. Leaves unfold again in cool weather.",,"These plants should be grown in sunny, somewhat sheltered and well drained areas. They are ideal plants for a difficult or neglected part of the garden and with the addition of other suitable plants can create stunning rock gardens. Companion plants such as Cotyledon orbiculata, Tylecodon paniculatus, Crassula arborescens, Aloe dichotoma, Aloe brevifolia, Pelargonium crithmifolium, Pelargonium sericifolia, etc., are ideal to start a rock garden.

Aloe microstigma is best grown from fresh seeds that are sown in summer or autumn. A coarse sandy medium must be used and seeds are sprinkled lightly and covered slightly with sand. If kept moist, (not wet) seeds germinate within two weeks. The most common pests on Aloe microstigma are scale, the aloe snout beetle, and aphids. These can all be successfully treated with contact or systemic pesticides. If plants are to be fed, use only organic based fertilisers in a liquid solution. These can be applied as a soil drench or sprayed on plants once a month. Another good plant food for aloes is bone meal. Bone meal is mixed in the soil and works wonders especially when planting or transplanting aloes.",,,Aloe microstigma is not recorded as a medicinal plant but it is said that the bitter sap has healing properties in cases of cuts and burn wounds. Plants are more favoured for their use in horticulture. They make particularly nice low maintenance garden plants which are especially attractive when in flower in the barren winter months.,,,,,
Bowkeria verticillata,Bowkeria verticillata,,"Bowkeria vercillata is a multi- or single-stemmed shrub about 3-5 m tall, occasionally a small tree. The stems are grey, branchlets are reddish and twigs with raised white dots. Oblong elliptical leaves are 25-130 x 6-65 mm, have entire or finely scalloped margins, sometimes hairy beneath and are borne in whorls of three to four. It is evergreen and the foliage makes a dense screen with a smell like other Bowkeria species.

The pure white, scented flowers (20 mm long), are sticky and glint in the sunshine, they are borne in pairs in the leaf axils, in early summer, from November to January. The inside of the flower shows a pattern of red marks which are probably a guide to the oil hairs for the pollinators. The fruit is a thinly woody, oval capsule (16 mm long) and splits into three valves during late summer (December to April). The fruits look as though they are made of polished cardboard and after having released the dust-like seed will remain on the plant for some time.","It was named in 1859 in recognition of the contribution by the well-known naturalist, Col. Henry Bowker and his sister Elizabeth, to South African botany.","This species is assessed as Least Concern (LC) by the Red List of South African Plants. It is not threatened.

Bowkeria verticillata is found on forest edges and particularly among thick evergreen scrub along small watercourses in KwaZulu-Natal and the Eastern Cape. It also grows well in full sun in gardens with temperate summers with a good rainfall; it is frost-tolerant but cannot withstand drought. Don't attempt to grow it at the coast as it dies off during the humid summer months.

Bowkeria is a small genus with three species confined to the eastern regions of South Africa.",,"There are no records of Bowkeria verticillata being used for traditional practices. It does have considerable value as a horticultural subject. The leaves are browsed.

Bowkeria verticillata is slow-growing; about 500 mm per year, and flowering begins after five years. It is pretty enough to be used as a single specimen or it mixes well in an informal screen. Good companion plants are Agapanthus and Crinum species.

Plant in full sun or semi-shade. The area should be composted and watered well in the first few years. It grows best in high rainfall summer areas and cannot survive drought. It will need supplementary watering in very dry periods. It is frost-hardy but will not do well in humid areas.

This species is particularly attractive while in flower because the dark green leaves contrast with the pure white, scented flowers.

Bowkeria verticillata can be propagated from seed or cuttings.

Collect fruit in autumn while still slightly green and keep in a paper bag to catch the fine seed, which can be stored in the fridge until the following spring. Seed germinates easily. Sow sparingly in a well-drained medium and place in a ventilated position to avoid fungal infection. Seedlings can be transplanted as soon as they are strong enough.

New green shoots or semi-hardwood cuttings, about 100 mm long, treated with rooting hormone, usually strike well in a mist bed.",,,,,,,,
Tree aloes,Aloidendron,,"Tree aloes form large trees and shrubs, with forked (dichotomous) branches. Most have a tall trunk and rounded crown. Some of the largest species can grow up to 20 m tall. Their grey to yellowish bark is smooth or longitudinally fissured and cracked, and often with a powdery bloom.

The succulent, erectly spreading to recurved leaves are carried in clusters (rosettes) at the tips of branches, and are narrowly lance- or sword-shaped in outline and boat-shaped in cross-section. Leaf margins are armed with small teeth and the leaf surface is green to grey-green with no spots.

Flowers are grouped in branched inflorescences with rather lax or dense, cylindric racemes (flower clusters). In the species occurring in the west of the genus’s distribution range, flowers are yellow, whereas they are pink or orange to reddish in the eastern species. Flowers are cylindric and slightly swollen in the middle. The fruit are capsules that dry out and split open to release the mature seed. Tree aloes all flower in late autumn to winter, except for Aloidendron pillansii that flowers in spring (October in the southern hemisphere).

Apart from the slow-growing A. pillansii and A. tongaensis, most other tree aloes are relatively fast growing. They are all long-lived plants. A specific quiver tree (A. dichotomum) was estimated to be between 100–145 years old.",The genus name is derived from combining the words ‘aloe’ and ‘dendron’ (= tree). It literally means ‘tree aloe’,"All species of Aloidendron appear on CITES (Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) Appendices, meaning that trade in tree aloes is controlled, to prevent utilisation that would be incompatible with their survival. Aloidendron pillansii is included in Appendix I, and trade in specimens of this tree aloe is permitted only in exceptional circumstances. The other tree aloes are all on Appendix II and, therefore, certain permits are required to trade in them.

In South Africa tree aloes are also protected by national and provincial environmental legislation. It is thus illegal to remove plants from their natural habitat without the necessary collecting and transport permits issued by a provincial or other nature conservation authority, and consent from the land owner.

In the Red List of South African plants, A. barberae and A. tongaensis are listed as Least Concern (LC), A. dichotomum and A. ramosissimum as Vulnerable (V) and A. pillansii as Endangered (E). Aloidendron eminens (from Somalia) is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Common threats to the survival of tree aloes are habitat degradation and destruction, trampling of seedlings by livestock, illegal harvesting and climate change.

The genus Aloidendron consists of six or seven species. The placement of Aloe sabaea in this genus is controversial and is not supported by all aloe enthusiasts. Southern Africa is a centre of diversity for tree aloes, as five of the species are endemic or near-endemic to this region. The two species not present in southern Africa are: Aloidendron eminens that is only found in Somalia, and Aloidendron sabaeum that only occurs in Saudi Arabia and Yemen.

Aloidendron barberae and A. tongaensis are confined to the summer-rainfall area and grow in the coastal forests of eastern and northeastern southern Africa. Aloidendron ramosissimum and A. pillansii is restricted to the Richtersveld in the winter-rainfall region of far northwestern South Africa and southeastern Namibia. Aloidendron dichotomum is one of the more widespread tree aloes and occurs in the predominantly winter-rainfall regions of the Northern Cape (South Africa) and Namibia.",,"Tree aloes are widely used in horticulture and landscaping, as they make good focal plants in large gardens. Their succulent nature also led them to be used as fire barriers around homesteads in fire-prone areas. The light, fibrous wood of Aloidendron dichotomum has been used in the construction of cool rooms or small houses in Namaqualand. Hollowed-out branches of this species was also traditionally used by the Khoi-San to make quivers for their arrows, hence the common name of quiver tree. Aloidendron pillansii seems to be an indicator of heavy metal soils in Namibia. The winter-rainfall species, especially Aloidendron dichotomum, are often seen as flagship species for climate change impacts on biodiversity. In northern KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, tree aloes are normally not cut down with the rest of the forest, as they are believed to protect against evil spirits and to serve as lightning conductors.

The fact that tree aloes adapt well to cultivation and are thus generally easily grown, has led to them being widely utilised as focal points in large gardens. However, the 3 tree aloes from the arid western regions, although easily grown in conditions simulating their natural habitat, are difficult to cultivate in high rainfall areas. All tree aloes prefer a well-drained position with no to very little frost. Aloidendron dichotomum, A. pillansii and A. ramosissimum prefer full sun, whereas A. barberae and A. tongaensis can tolerate more shady conditions.

Most tree aloes (except A. dichotomum and A. pillansii, and to some extent A. ramosissimum) can be grown from stem cuttings or truncheons. Cuttings should be made during the warmer months, using a sharp pruning shear or saw and the wound treated to prevent infection. Cuttings can be planted directly into the required position and normally root within 1 to 3 months.

All tree aloes can fairly easily be grown from seed and are relatively fast growing (except A. tongaensis and A. pillansii). Seed are best sown in spring to autumn and will generally germinate within three weeks. When seedlings are large enough (normally within a year) they can be planted out and hardened off.",,,,,,,,
Tarchonanthus trilobus var. trilobus,Tarchonanthus trilobus var. trilobus,camphor scent,"A shrub or small tree 4 to 8m high with a clean trunk and a dense spreading crown of decorative, bi-coloured leaves. The bark is dark grey, vertically fissured and cracked, flaking off in narrow strips.

The leaves are strongly scented, dark green and wrinkled above, densely velvety-white underneath but with veins and midrib still clearly visible, variable in shape but typically narrow at the base with broad three-lobed tips. Young growth is woolly and cream-white.

Flowerheads are small, thistle-like, yellowish to cream, in branched inflorescences 5-10 cm long, in the axils of the leaves. At Kirstenbosch they flower in autumn-winter (May-June). Tarchonanthus is dioecious, i.e. male and female flowers are carried on different trees. Taking a closer look at the flowerheads requires a magnifying lens as the individual flowers are tiny. Male flowerheads contain 10-16 flowers and are conspicuous and decorative. Each flower has a tubular or funnel-shaped corolla of 5 recurved lobes, covered with woolly hairs on the outside. The anthers taper gradually into a long flat tail-shaped apical appendage. The style is narrowly cylindrical but there is no ovary. The female flowerheads are made up of only 1 flower, and are not decorative. Each flower has a short 4- or 5-lobed corolla tube, covered with woolly hairs on the outside. The style branches are short, flat and egg-shaped and there are no stamens.

The fruit is a thinly woolly nutlet, 5 x 1 mm, inside the fluffy flowerhead. Being familiar with the showy, white, cotton-wool-like fruits of Tarchonanthus littoralis (previously known as T.camphoratus - see the revision by Herman (2002)), I was expecting this species to put on a similar show, but these female fruits are much less woolly and are not showy.","There are two possible explanations for the name Tarchonanthus. One, that it is based on the Arabic name tarchon for Artemisia dracunculus and the Greek anthos meaning flower, alluding to the similarity of the flowerheads of the two species. The other, that it is derived from the Greek tarchos meaning funeral rites, and anthos meaning flower, perhaps due to the camphor scent of the leaves. The species name trilobus means three-lobed in Latin, referring to the typically 3-lobed leaves.","Tarchonanthus trilobus is divided into two varieties: var. trilobus and var. galpinii. At one time they were regarded as two separate species: Tarchonanthus trilobus and T. galpinii. var. trilobus has leaves with broad three-lobed tips and it has a more southerly distribution from the Eastern Cape to KZN; var. galpinii (broad-leaved camphor bush, breëblaarkanferbos) has oblong, oval or lance-shaped leaves with rounded or pointed tips and it has a more northerly distribution from KZN into Swaziland, Mpumalanga and Limpopo. Tarchonanthus trilobus var. trilobus is not threatened.
Tarchonanthus trilobus var. trilobus grows on rocky outcrops, in thicket, in wooded ravines, on hillsides and on forest margins in the Eastern Cape and Kwa-Zulu Natal.Tarchonanthus belongs in the daisy family. It is a small genus of a few species that occur in tropical and southern Africa. Until recently only two species were recognized in southern Africa: Tarchonanthus camphoratus and T. trilobus but P.P.J. Herman of the National Herbarium in Pretoria, after studying the herbarium material, found that a number of distinct species had been grouped under T. camphoratus.
He revised the Tarchonanthus camphoratus complex in 2002 and, based on differences in inflorescences, flowering times, leaf shape and margin and distribution, now recognizes five species that were all once lumped together under T. camphoratus : T. camphoratus, T. littoralis, T. minor, T. obovatus and T. parvicapitulatus. Thus, today we recognize six southern African species of Tarchonanthus, and T. trilobus is further divided into the two varieties.
Tarchonanthus species are sometimes confused with Brachylaena but they can be told apart as follows: the fruits of Tarchonanthus are enclosed in white wool whereas those of Brachylaena have a bristly (shaving brush-like) pappus, and although the leaves of both genera are fragrant, Tarchonanthus leaves are distinguished by a distinct camphor scent.
The leaves and stems are browsed by black rhino and other game.
The fruits are light and encased in soft woolly hairs and are readily dispersed by wind.
Tarchonanthus trilobus wood is bright brown with yellow graining, hard, durable and aromatic, with a lovely camphor scent.

",,"Tarchonanthus trilobus is a quick-growing, handsome, small tree with a dense crown and curiously shaped, decorative, bi-coloured foliage. It is not common in cultivation, but is an excellent garden subject, is recommended as a street tree and is a good choice for a small suburban garden. It will not get too big and it has non-invasive roots that will not damage paving. It can be pruned and shaped when young. Plant in well-drained, fertile soil in a sunny position. Water generously and deeply during its first few years; once established it requires little maintenance. Although coming from the summer-rainfall region, it grows well in the winter-rainfall Western Cape, coping with the harsh coastal conditions and summer drought. It is frost hardy, but will probably not survive severe frosts and needs protection from frost when young.

Tarchonanthus trilobus var. trilobus is not easily propagated by cuttings, but can be propagated by seed, and young self-sown seedlings transplant easily.

Seed is best sown in spring to early summer. Seed is ripe when the flowerheads detach relatively easily from the inflorescence, i.e. by gently pulling or knocking them off. It is quite a fiddly task to remove the tiny seeds from the woolly flowerheads and they will germinate if sown with the remains of the flowerhead attached provided they do not get too wet and are treated with a fungicide that combats pre-emergence damping off. Use a well-drained sowing medium, cover lightly - enough to stop them from blowing away, keep moist but not wet and in a warm but not hot position. Seedlings can be potted up when they are strong enough to handle.

Tarchonanthus trilobus var. trilobus cuttings do not root easily. Take heel cuttings of semi-hardwood side shoots, in spring, treat with rooting hormone and place under mist using bottom heat. Air-layering trials also yielded poor results in that the cuttings formed a callus but not roots. The most reliable method is to transplant the self-sown seedlings from under the trees.",,,"No reference was found to Tarchonanthus trilobus var. trilobus being used medicinally, but T. trilobus var. galpinii and other Tarchonanthus species are used and it is likely that this species is used in a similar way. T. trilobus var. galpinii roots and bark are used to improve libido and for vomiting. The trunk is used for construction, including the building of the King's kraal. T. littoralis is used to perfume women's hair, and smoking dried leaves is said to have a sedative effect. Both T. littoralis and T. camphoratus are used to treat headaches, toothache, abdominal pain and respiratory ailments like asthma, bronchitis and whooping cough, and to make tonics.",,,,,
Aloe pearsonii,Aloe pearsonii,,"They are densely branched and erect plants with their lower stem area often covered with dead, persistent leaves and the upper area with living leaves. Branching may take place from the base of the stem or higher up.

The densely arranged leaves are elongate-triangular, mainly downward curving and arranged in four ranks. The dull bluish-green leaves often turn red, especially in times of drought. The backward curving leaves give the rosettes a distinctive appearance that is unmistakable of this species.

The inflorescence is often branched low down into two or three head-shaped racemes. Flower colour is varied from red, yellow and red-yellow. Aloe pearsonii is summer flowering (Dec.-Jan.). As with other aloes, the seeds are typically winged, small, up to 4 mm, and produced in abundance inside the fruit capsules that split into three when ripe. Seeds ripen quickly as a result of the extreme heat, normally around February to March.

","The genus name Aloe is derived from the Arabic, alloch, and translated as allal in Greek and Hebrew, literally meaning bitter or bitter sap, which is descriptive of aloe sap. The species epithet pearsonii was given in honour of the first director of Kirstenbosch Botanic Garden, Prof. Harold H.W. Pearson, who collected the plants in 1910.","Aloe pearsonii is regarded as endangered as a result of illegal collecting and of habitat loss due to mining activities and overgrazing (Van Wyk & Smith 2003). In its habitat, however, it is still found in abundance, often seen covering slopes and foothills.

Aloe pearsonii is highly localized and thus an endemic of the Richtersveld around Helskloof and the adjacent mountains across the Gariep (Orange) River in Namibia. It occurs at altitudes of about 300 to 1500 m (950-5000 ft). At Helskloof, dense colonies dominate the landscape and colour all the mountain slopes (Williamson 2000).

Aloe pearsonii grows in a variety of soils which are mainly granite, sandstone and shale derived. The many different formations of the Gariep Super Group comprise rock such as conglomerate, sandstone, quartzite, shale, limestone, dolomite, schist, lava, volcanic breccia and tuff (Van Wyk & Smith 2001). The soils in which A. pearsonii grows are usually sandy, shallow and stony, but clayey soils do occur.

Aloe pearsonii seems to prefer slopes, hills and plateaus of the arid landscapes in the Richtersveld and surrounds. It is most regularly seen in exposed situations but colonies do occur in valleys with deep ravines, where they are more blue-green as a result of morning and afternoon shady conditions. Aloe pearsonii is probably the least typical of the creeping aloes but it fits very comfortably in the group as it has the same rather unique combination of chemical compounds in the leaves as is present in all five related species: A. meyeri, A. distans, A. dabenorisana, A. perfoliata and A. arenicola (Van Wyk & Smith 2003). Plants can grow as quite large specimens or much-branched shrubs of up to x 2 m or more.

All species of creeping aloes flower in the dry summer months and occur in the Northern, Western and Eastern Cape Provinces of South Africa. It is noteworthy that five of the six creeping aloes are threatened in one way or another. The genus Aloe has recently undergone revision and some of the names listed above may have changed.

Aloe pearsonii produces nectar and is pollinated by sugarbirds as well as winged and crawling insects such as ants which are small enough to enter the flower tube in which the nectar is stored. After fertilization, the fruit, which is a capsule, grows quickly and splits into three parts at the end of the summer. The seeds are small, up to 4 mm, and slightly winged enabling them to be dispersed by the wind. Pieces of the stem that break off may also root when conditions are ideal.

The plant in itself is very tough and can often survive for several seasons without water, at which point the leaves turn reddish, a sign generally associated with stress. Groups of Aloe pearsonii are often found in places inhabited by hyraxes, otherwise known as rock dassies (Procavia capensis). The droppings of these cuddly looking mammals, whose closest relatives are elephants, can easily be seen in close proximity to colonies of Aloe pearsonii and A. gariepensis (Gariep River aloe). It is a known fact that the roots and stems of these plants serve as a source of moisture or food.",,"The horticultural value of Aloe pearsonii in gardens goes without saying, although this particular species has proven difficult in cultivation.

It is a well-known and established plant in gardens of keen succulent collectors. For smaller gardens the plants can be used in deep plant boxes or pots. The ideal garden planting is a group of about 20 plants. Again it must be emphasized that Aloe pearsonii struggles away from its natural habitat: to be grown successfully it needs hot weather. For optimal flowering, remember to plant it in full sun. Raised rock gardens that allow good drainage are the best situations for these plants. Alternatively, plants can be grown in containers in glasshouses during the winter and brought out in the summer.

Growing Aloe pearsonii is not as easy to grow as the other creeping aloes. Although it is possible to grow these plants from cuttings and offsets, it takes a very long time to grow new roots and the dangers of over-watering and disease is always present.

The best results are achieved from seeds. Seeds must be sown as fresh as possible. When kept too long they are parasitized by small crawling insects. The best time for sowing is in the late summer before winter sets in, around February to May. Use coarse river sand and cover seeds lightly, then keep moist. It is advisable to treat seeds with a long-lasting fungicide, as seedlings are prone to damping off, a fungus that eventually kills the young plants. Simply shake seeds in a container with some fungicide.

After germination, when plants are about 20-30 mm high, transplant them using a sandy-loam medium and feed with organic-based fertilizer at least once a month to ensure healthy growth. If you have a garden with clay soil, use some agricultural lime and bone meal to break up and nourish the soil.

Mature plants in cultivation may at times be subjected to attack from scale insects and aphids. For scale insects, an oil-based solution can be used, even soap water has proven effective, and the best results are obtained by physically removing the scale, using a cloth. Contact insecticides usually work well but in heavy infestations a systemic application may be necessary. All known garden pests can be kept to a minimum by simply ensuring optimal growing conditions and healthy plants.

Companion plants to Aloe pearsonii include A. melanacantha, A. claviflora, A. falcata, A. gariepensis, A. dichotoma, A. dichotoma subsp. ramosissima and A. arenicola.. Other plants to consider are Lampranthus aureus, L. multiradiatus, L. reptans, Pelargonium echinatum, P. xerophytum, P. spinosum, P. sericifolia, P. crithmifolium, Tripteris oppositifolium, Stoeberia arborea, Gazania krebsiana, Hermannia saccifera and Oscularia deltoides. Larger succulents such as Tylecodon paniculatus, Cyphostemma juttea and Cotyledon orbiculata are also good choices.",,,"While there are no records of this particular species as a food source for humans, the yellow bitter sap in the leaves, as with other aloes, can be used as a laxative and to heal wounds.",,,,,
Pentarrhinum insipidum,Pentarrhinum insipidum,,"Pentarrhinum insipidum is a slender, fast-growing, branching vine that sprouts from a woody, perennial rootstock and produces stems 2-3 m long. It scrambles over other shrubs or twines itself around trees and bushes. All the parts are delicately covered with hairs. The leaves are simple, stalked and broadly ovate to heart-shaped with a deep cordate base and pointed tip; the leaf blade is 200-650 x 15-50 mm; the stalks are 15-50 mm long, usually pointing downwards.

The corollas of the flowers are reflexed, arranged in lateral pseudo-umbels which hang from the nodes and are small, greenish to yellow, with the basal parts of the corolla sometimes tinged purple to brown. A white form occurs in the coastal areas of KwaZulu-Natal. The corona is white, beige, yellow or orange to brown-greenish, fleshy with a horn-like appendage. Flowers are fragrant and aromatic and are produced from November to April. The fruit is usually a solitary follicle, somewhat inflated, lance-shaped with an uneven, warty surface, 55-85 x 15-20 mm, with teeth 2-4 mm long. The seed is 6.0-6.5 x 4 mm, tightly packed, flat, with a marginal wing and with a tuft of white hairs at the one end.","The generic name is derived from the Greek words penta meaning 'five' and rhynchos meaning 'snout', which probably refers to the shape of the corona. The epithet insipidus is Latin and means 'to be without taste'. The genus is restricted to Africa and consists of three species of which two are found in southern Africa.

This species was first described in 1738 by Burmann (at that time placed in the genus Cynanchum ). The plant was moved to its own genus, Pentarrhinum, in 1837 by Ernest Meyer. Subsequently five more species were described but most of them were later sunk into synonymy. The placement of the genus in relation to other genera remains uncertain. The second species in southern Africa is P. abyssinicum with two subspecies.","This plant is currently neither threatened nor protected, but widespread and quite common where it occurs.

The African heartvine is endemic to Africa. It is distributed in two large disjunct regions: 1, South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Mozambique and Malawi ; and 2, northern Zambia, Tanzania, Kenya and Ethiopia, with smaller outliers probably reflecting the different ecological and climatic conditions in Africa.

It is widespread in grassland, bush-clumps, savanna or forest margins. It can be cultivated almost anywhere-from areas with strong frost to hot and humid areas. It dies back in unfavourable conditions and resprouts in springtime. Pentarrhinum insipidum is associated with shrubland and savanna, in dry or well-drained conditions, but does not tolerate extremes of dry and wet. It ranges from sea level up to 2200 m, but is most common between 600-1600 m.Pelargonium is one of 5 southern African genera in the Geraniaceae, the pelargonium family. There are approximately 250 species of Pelargonium in southern Africa. The other southern African genera in Geraniaceae include: Erodium, Geranium, Monsonia and Sarcocaulon. This cosmopolitan family is predominantly confined to temperate and subtropical regions such as S, E and NE Africa, Australia, New Zealand, St Helena, Tristan da Cunha, Madagascar and Asia. Southern Africa, home to more than 80% of the species, is the global hotspot of Pelargonium. The highest diversity amongst members of this family is found in the Namaqualand-region, and the western and southern Cape of South Africa.",,"Pentarrhinum insipidum is best grown from fresh seed. Sow seeds in spring. Remove the tuft of hairs and sow them in a well-drained mix of one part sandy soil and one part compost. Cover seeds lightly with the mix. Water regularly and ensure that the substrate is kept moist until the seedlings are large enough to transplant. Decrease watering during winter. Plants grow rapidly from seed. Protect the plant for the first couple of years during winter.

It is best used as a container plant. When planted directly into the soil it may smother or grow over companion plants and become untidy.It is attacked by aphids and is one of the host plants of the African Monarch butterfly.",,,"In Tanzania, a decoction of the leaves is used to wash boils, and after washing, the boils are covered with hot leaves. In Malawi, the roots are used medicinally. The leaves and young branches make a good fodder for cattle. Sometimes the leaves are pounded together with leaves or tubers of other species and eaten as a salad. Harvested young fruits can last for up to three weeks before they deteriorate and are utilised as a vegetable or preserved like gherkins. It apparently has a crisp, nutty and slightly peppery taste. Because the older fruits are too tough, they are not consumed. The whole plant exudes a white latex.

The plant has potential as a crop plant and experimentation in this regard is currently being done. When boiled, the leaves and young fruit have the same taste and consistency as asparagus. The leaves are rich in calcium, iron and riboflavin. Young fruits have high concentrations of magnesium and copper.",,,,,
Pelargonium sericifolium,Pelargonium sericifolium,,"A small, much-branched, evergreen, shrub of 0.2 × 0.3 m. Simple, silvery green, wedge-shaped leaves, are shallowly lobed at the end and up to 10 mm long. The leaves are covered with dense silvery hairs or, in botanical terms, a sericeus indumentum. This covering gives the plant a silvery appearance.

Cerise flowers of about 15 mm in diameter, in groups of 1–3, can be found from the end of winter (late July) to mid-spring (October). The pedicel of 1–3 mm long, and hypanthium of 35–60 mm long, are both sericeus. Silvery green, ovate to narrowly ovate sepals, are 7–9 mm long and 2–3 mm wide. Intense dark purple, linear markings, which merge near the base, can be found on the bottom 3 petals. Seven fertile stamens, all in variable sizes, are present. The pollen is yellow-lemon.","The name Pelargonium is derived from the Greek word pelargos, meaning ‘stork’ because the rostrum of the schizocarp in Pelargonium is thought to resemble the bill of a stork. This explains the common name, stork’s bill. The specific epithet sericifolium, is derived from sericeus, which means ‘silky’ and is in reference to the conspicuous silky indumentum of the leaves. Pelargonium sericifolium was first collected by Drège at Kaus Mountain, in 1838. Harvey used the very same specimen when he described the new species in 1860, under the name P. sericeum. However, this specific name had by then already been in use since 1796 for the species that is today known as Pelargonium crassicaule. This resulted in the name being changed to sericifolium, which is of similar meaning.","According to the Red List of South African plants, checked on 7 September 2017, the conservation status of this species is Least Concern (LC).

The naaldekoker is restricted to the Spektakelberg outside Springbok and Kosies Mountain, near Sannagas, in the Namaqualand-region of the Northern Cape. In these broken and mountainous areas of Succulent Karoo, it grows on granite, gneiss and deep red sand.

Annual rainfall in this area is between 100–200 mm. The perennial presence of early morning mist is believed to supplement precipitation. The summers can be extremely hot, with occasional frost in winter. Pelargonium sericifolium is among 23 species found in the section Ligularia within the genus Pelargonium. All these species possess relatively strong branches with subsucculent stems that are often woody at the base. Leaves are seldom entire, but rather pinnately divided. The petals are subequal and spathulate with a tapering base. Seven fertile stamens can be found. Several other species found in this section include: P. abrotanifolium, P. crassipes, P. pulchellum, P. hirtum and P. fragile.",,"Pelargoniums are generally popular garden ornamentals and some species are extensively cultivated for their medicinal properties. Essential oils found in the leaves of some species, is often used in the food, perfume and pharmaceutical industries.

This very rewarding groundcover grows easily from cuttings and seed.

Cuttings can be taken throughout the year, with best results achieved in autumn. Take stem cuttings larger than 30 mm, cut below the node and dip in a rooting hormone. The cuttings can then be placed in prepared holes in a rooting medium, such as coarse river sand. Prior to this, provision needs to be made to ensure the medium is sterilized. Cuttings can then be placed in a slightly shady place or a cold frame. Roots should appear after 3–4 weeks. Undertake potting only once a proper root system has developed.

Sow seed in late summer or early autumn, in a well-draining medium and cover with a very thin layer of white river sand or compost. Water seed evenly with a very fine spray. Take care not to overwater, but also not to allow the medium to dry out completely.

Rooted cuttings and seedlings respond well to a liquid seaweed-based fertilizer. Feed adult pot plants with 3:1:5 once in autumn. This can be supplemented with a seaweed-based, liquid fertilizer application every fortnight during the growing season.

An extensive, deep root system, makes the transplanting of the naaldekoker from a garden, a challenge. Plants do pot on very easily though.

This species makes a stunning pot plant and has minimal pest and disease issues. Limit watering over the summer to once or twice over a fortnight, to prevent rotting. Increase watering with the onset of autumn.

Gasteria pulchra is related to G. nitida which is a smaller grassland plant with much shorter triangular leaves.","Gasteria pulchra was named by William Aiton in 1789 as a variety of his Aloe maculata in Hortus Kewensis. Adrian Haworth, the British succulent student, in 1804 raised its status to species level. The specific epithet 'pulchra' is derived from Latin (meaning beautiful).

It is not known who first collected Gasteria pulchra, but according to P. Miller (1758) it ""was raised from seeds in the Chelsea Gardens (London), which were brought from the Cape of Good Hope by Captain Hutchinson of the 'Godolphin Indiaman'"".","Gasteria pulchra is locally common and currently not threatened.

Gasteria pulchra is quite common in the Hankey and Patensie districts in the Gamtoos Valley and in adjacent regions of the Eastern Cape Province. It is distributed from Studtis, in Baviaanskloof in the northwest, to Hankey in the southeast.

Gasteria pulchra is mainly confined to Gamtoos Thicket which is part of the Albany Thicket vegetation and occurs in hilly terrain which is difficult to penetrate (Mucina & Rutherford 2006). It grows in a succulent-rich community, often among thorny shrubs (nurse plants), small trees and herbs.

Typical small trees and shrubs in the habitat include Portulacaria afra, Boscia oleoides, Cussonia gamtoosensis, Azima tetracantha, Carissa bispinosa and Searsia longispina. Smaller associated succulents in the habitat include Aloe africana, A. ciliaris, Crassula orbicularis, C. perforata, C. pellucida subsp. marginalis, Delosperma echinatum and Senecio pyramidatus.

The climate is hot in summer and mild in winter. The rainfall is 300-400 mm per year and occurs in both summer and winter, but there is a tendency to winter dryness. The geology consists of mainly Enon Conglomerate soil, poor in minerals and slightly acidic. The average annual daily maximum temperature is about 23°C and the average daily minimum about 10°C.",,"Easily propagated from seed, division or leaf cuttings. It is best to apply a fungicide when growing from seed. Sow seed during spring or summer in a warm, shady position in a sandy slightly acidic soil and keep moist. Cover with a thin layer of sand and keep moist. Germination is usually within three weeks. Seedlings grow slowly and are best planted out about a year after sowing. Propagation from leaf cuttings is best undertaken in spring. Allow the leaf cutting to form a heel by placing it on a dry window sill for a week or three. Cuttings are best rooted in clean sand. Once rooted, plants can be planted into individual containers. Plants react well to organic feeding (compost or any other liquid fertilizer).

Ledebouria sandersonii,Ledebouria sandersonii,"Flowers of Ledebouria sandersonii are open, cup-shaped and unscented,","Solitary or weakly gregarious (forming loose clumps), deciduous bulbous plant, with small bulbs (30 × 30 mm). Plants may produce between 3–6, mostly broadly rounded leaves, which may be unspotted or have darker spots and blotches. The leaves of this species vary considerably with many regional forms, ranging from bright green to dull green.

The brightly coloured flowers are produced mainly in spring and summer (September to December in South Africa) on unbranched spikes, bearing numerous single, mostly lilac to pink flowers, usually with a green keel and purple stamens. The flowers are arranged along the central peduncle (main stalk), each on a short pedicel (flower stalk), which is often lilac or pinkish in this species.

The small, drop-shaped seeds are produced following the flowers, in green capsules, which split open to reveal the shiny brownish black and wrinkled seeds.","This species was originally named by Baker as Scilla sandersonii in 1870. J.P. Jessop included it under the broader concept of L. cooperii in his 1970 treatment of the genus. Dr S. Venter reinstated the species in his 1993 M.Sc. revision of the genus in 1993. However, it was only formally published by the same author in 2003.

The genus Ledebouria is named in honour of the German-Estonian botanist Professor Carl Friedrich von Ledebour (1785–1851). The species name sandersonii, honours John Sanderson (1820–1881), journalist, trader and draughtsman.","Least Concern (LC). This species is widespread and very common over large areas of South Africa; it is not considered to be threatened in its natural habitat.

Ledebouria sandersonii is widespread across the eastern parts of South Africa in the Limpopo, Mpumalanga, Gauteng, FreeState, KwaZulu-Natal and Eastern Cape Provinces. The species is often locally common, where it occurs mostly in moist grassland and savanna. South Africa has 42 species of Ledebouria. The genus is distributed across Africa, India and Madagascar, with the centre of species diversity in the eastern parts of southern Africa.

This species is most easily confused with L. cooperi which typically has more lanceolate and more erect leaves.",,"Ledebouria sandersonii is not difficult to maintain in cultivation and makes a rewarding container plant. The plants prefer a cool climate, such as that found at higher altitudes and enjoys plenty of water,especially during the active growth period in summer. The species enjoys a humus-rich clay loam or loam soil, with some compost and kraal (cattle) manure added. Summer rains are frequent in the range of this species and it often grows in seepages in grassland where it is wet all summer long. During the cold, dry dormant season in winter, the pots are best kept almost dry, with a light watering occasionally, to prevent complete desiccation.

The best way to propagate this species is from seed, sown as fresh as possible and not stored for prolonged periods. Sow the seed in a sifted loamy soil, as mentioned above, in pots or trays on a firmly tamped surface. Cover the seed with about 3–5 mm of the sifted mixture and keep constantly damp, until all the seeds have germinated. Seedlings can be pricked out or left in their natal container for the first year to establish sizable bulbs.

Lithops optica,Lithops optica,,"Lithops optica consists of an oblong obconical almost club-shaped leaf pair up to 20 mm long. The leaf pairs are often unequal, rounded-truncate at their tops and up to 15 x 12 mm in diameter with a smooth texture, deeply fissured and whitish grey to grey green in colour. There is a reddish colour form, Lithops optica cv. Rubra, with ruby milky pink sides and light to dark ruby-red windows. The bodies become wrinkled during the dry summers. They divide with age forming small clusters of up to 10 bodies. It is possible to estimate the age of a Lithops optica colony by counting the dried-up shells of old bodies, and specimens have been found with ages estimated at 50 to 95 years or more. The flowers are white, sometimes with pink tips, 12-20 mm in diameter and appear during autumn. The fruiting capsule is mostly 5-chambered.

","Their resemblance to stones has also given the genus its scientific name: from the Greek lithos meaning stone and opsis meaning appearance or resemblance. They are known in Afrikaans as beeskloutjies (bees means ox/cattle and kloutjie feet), because the plants also look like miniature hoofprints of cattle.","Lithops optica is endemic (i.e. it occurs naturally nowhere else on Earth) to the Lüderitz district of the southern Namib Desert where it grows on the coastal plains. Its habitat is very sandy and it is often found growing among rocks and gravel where it is very difficult to spot. Its climate is cool due to the cold Atlantic Ocean and frequent fog, and rainfall is mainly during the winter, ranging between 20-50 mm per annum. The genus Lithops consists of about 33 species widely distributed in the western, southern and central regions of southern Africa, i.e. Namibia, Botswana and all provinces of South Africa except for Mpumalanga and KwaZulu-Natal. They occur mainly in the Nama Karoo and succulent Karoo and are especially common along the Orange River valley in the Northern Cape. The first Lithops was discovered by William John Burchell in 1811 to the south east of the present-day Northern Cape town of Prieska during his nearly five year journey of exploration in southern Africa.

Rainfall in lithops habitats ranges between 25 and 400 mm per annum and falls mainly during spring and autumn with less frequent showers during the rest of the year. Temperatures vary, the average daily maximum ranges between 18 and 28 degrees centigrade and the daily minimum between 8 and 12 degrees centigrade.",,"Lithops has been very well spread by cultivation and is an example of ex-situ conservation, i.e. where plants have been effectively conserved out of habitat. Seed and plants of all species and many cultivars are today available from specialist succulent nurseries not only in South Africa but also in the USA, Europe and Japan. Plants are relatively easily grown but great care needs to be taken with soil, temperature, time and amount of watering. If it is mastered, growing them becomes a pleasure. Lithops out of habitat are best grown in a container in a greenhouse where watering and temperature can be controlled. Although lithops originate from a very sunny terrain care should be taken in cultivation not to expose a plant that has been grown in partial shade too suddenly to full sun as the sun will cause leaf burn resulting in death or disfigurement. Plants should gradually be hardened off by exposing them to brighter light conditions over a period of time to allow the plant to adjust.

Grow Lithops optica in soil that consists of a sandy gravel mixture (e.g. 2 parts sand : 1 part clay loam : 1 part gravel). Add ample bone meal and dolomitic lime. Lithops optica is best planted in a sunny and airy part of the greenhouse, and not too close to the glass roof or sides of the house as the plants can overheat during hot spells. They do not necessarily need direct sun all day and are best protected from the withering midday and afternoon sun. They do best in a situation under a translucent roof fitted with shade cloth that gives them bright but filtered sunlight all day. Watering should be very sparing and only during the late autumn and early winter months, e.g. no more frequently than once in two weeks, even once every three to four weeks, but when watered, they should be drenched so that the water reaches the bottom of the container. A diluted fertiliser can be added to the water, one with trace elements and a low nitrogen high potassium content is best. It is also best to water in the mornings so that the excess water evaporates and the upper layers of soil dry out fairly quickly. Lithops like nothing less than wet, soggy soil. Although the plant will survive mild frost it should be protected from severe cold and prolonged frost conditions. Plants can be hand pollinated, using a small paint brush. Remember always to cross different clones as the plants are self-sterile. The seed will remain viable for many years provided it is stored in a cool dry place.

Lithops optica seeds germinate readily. It is best sown during the warmer summer months when germination is rapid. Sow the seed evenly in sandy free-draining soil with little or no organic matter in it, and cover with a very thin layer of fine sand. This layer acts to support the young seedling after germination. Because the seed is so fine, it is best to water gently with a very fine rose, or to plunge the seed tray into a tray of water and allow the water to seep upwards to avoid displacing the seed. Place the seedling trays in a warm sunny position, keep them moist but not soggy and add a fungicide with each watering. Humidity can be increased by placing a sheet of fibre-glass or glass over the tray, but raised slightly at one end to allow for some air movement. Germination occurs within 3 weeks and the seedlings develop rapidly. After germination, if you have been watering from below, don't do it anymore. Reduce watering so that the top 6mm layer may dry out but not the soil below. Excessive watering during this period may cause damping off of the seedlings. After they are two or three months old, they can be allowed to dry out completely for a few days between waterings, and the period between waterings gradually increased so as to harden them for adulthood. The young plants can be transplanted after a year, and flowering can be achieved within 3-4 years. Take note that not all the seed will germinate immediately and you may find seedlings appearing months, even a year later.

It is also possible to divide a multiheaded plant, but lithops prefer to grow clustered together and many growers prefer to leave them undisturbed to see how large a cluster can get. To separate a cluster, lift the plant, carefully cut through the rootstock and replant them immediately.",,,,,,,,
Oldenburgia grandis,Oldenburgia grandis,,"Oldenburgia grandis is a unique, long-lived tree, with a robust, thick-set, gnarled trunk and strong branch structure. It is a slow-growing plant, reaching a height of between 4 and 6 m, with a trunk up to 460 mm in circumference. The bark is dark, thick and corky. It has stiff, spreading branches with a woolly covering on the younger parts. The crown is composed of large leaves that are stiff and leathery.

The leaves are arranged on the stems in opposite pairs and at right angles to the next pair; however, the new leaves emerge as rosettes at the ends of the branches. The leaves are up to 360 mm long and 150 mm broad, oblong or egg-shaped, with the leaf margins rolled inwards and the surface rounded above. The mature leaves are deep green, shiny with a greyish white midrib. The undersides are velvety white, with a broad and protruding midrib. The two surfaces make a lovely colour contrast. The young leaves are silverywhite and densely furry. Tthe leaves are said to be poisonous.

The flower-heads are borne on long, stout, velvety white stems (peduncles), which emerge from the centre of the rosette of leaves. Each flower-head resembles a giant thistle with its short, wide, purple brush covered thickly with velvety white hairs.

The flower-head opens wider as it matures, reaching 100–130 mm in diameter, to expose the fruits.

The fruits are small, thin, brown nutlets, crowned with a tuft of long, bristly hairs. Flowering is irregular throughout the year, often with a burst in autumn.","The genus Oldenburgia was named after P.F. Oldenburg, a companion of the botanists, Thunberg and Masson on their travels to South Africa. Oldenburg died of fever in Madagascar in 1774. The young leaves are remarkably like the ears of a young rabbit, lamb, or donkey in texture, hence the common names. The common name suikerbos refers to the flowerheads that bear some resemblance to those of the true suikerbos in the family Proteaceae. In reality there is little resemblance between Asteraceae and Proteaceae. Oldenburgia grandis was one of the first species to be introduced to Kirstenbosch Botanical Gardens. It was collected near Grahamstown by the Galpin brothers and introduced to Kirstenbosch in November 1913.","The population of this species is stable and it is therefore listed as LC (Least Concern).

Oldenburgia grandis is an Eastern Cape endemic, occurring on rocky outcrops of the Witteberg quartzites from the Suurberg, near Port Elizabeth, to Grahamstown. Near Grahamstown it grows on hard sandstone outcrops according to Giles Mbambezeli.

Oldenburgia grandis grows on the border of the winter- and summer-rainfall regions of South Africa. It is occasionally exposed to both winter and summer rains at the western end of its distribution, but generally experiences dry winters. It grows in well-drained, acidic soils and is limited to quartzite or sandstone outcrops or rocky ridges, where it is exposed to full sun and good ventilation. It experiences high temperatures between 30–40ºC, and low temperatures between 5–10ºC, and is sensitive to frost. The genus Oldenburgia has four species that are endemic to areas in Western and Eastern Cape. The other three species are O. intermedia, O. papionum, and O. paradoxa. The dense silvery hairs on the young leaves serve to protect them from sun and wind damage.

This species escapes fire due to its habitat, but may survive a light burn due to its thick, corky bark.

It is pollinated by the Cape honey bee, Apis mellifera capensis and birds such as the Cape Sugarbird, Promerops cafer and the Red-winged Starling, Onychognathus morio.

Seed is released when flowers mature and each nutlet, with its tuft of bristly hair, forms a small parachute that either floats to the ground or is distributed by wind. This species only colonizes rocky habitats.",,"Oldenburgia grandis is a novelty plant that will be of interest to specialist plant collectors. It will make a lovely feature plant in a well-drained, sunny position in the garden or in a large pot. The dry flower-heads make lovely dried flower arrangements.

Contrary to various sources, Oldenburgia grandis germinates easily from seed. Seedlings have even been found germinating in the old flower-head while still attached to the plant. Seed germinates readily when smoke treated or treated with Seed Primer containing smoke extract. Sow seed onto a well-drained, acidic, growing medium consisting of a combination of river sand and well-decomposed pine bark or washed peat in roughly equal proportions. Seeds germinate in about six weeks, emerging as small, fleshy cotyledons that must be lightly watered with a watering can. The seedlings should be carefully potted into small individual pots at cotyledon stage; before the first pair of true leaves develop, as this species does not react well to disturbance. Young seedlings are encouraged to grow, by feeding them with diluted organic fertiliser. Keep in a well-ventilated, warm, sunny position where the seed and young plants are protected from rain. Oldenburgia does not like too much water which will cause the young plants to rot. Water the plants well and then allow the medium to dry out between watering. In other words treat them like succulents.

It is good practice to protect the seeds from rotting by treating them with a pre-emergence fungicide to prevent damping off. These fungicides are available at your local nursery. This species is slow growing and should be kept in the smallest possible container and only re-potted when it becomes well established in its container.

Oldenburgia grandis has also been propagated by truncheon. This is obviously only possible when a large plant is available. It has been reported that a branch that broke from a mature specimen at Kirstenbosch rooted when put into the ground.

Truncheons are branches, about as thick as a human arm that can be rooted and grown into new plants. Truncheons are usually taken when the plant is dormant or in its resting stage. The erythrinas in the Kirstenbosch Avenue were propagated in this way. Truncheon sections are about 1.7–1.8 m long, with the top of the branch cut at a slant, which prevents water from rotting the truncheon. Before planting the truncheon, it should first be kept in the shade for a few days to develop a hard layer over the cut end. If the cut end is not covered with this hard layer, the truncheon may not root. The truncheon should be planted into a narrow hole about 600 mm deep. The best time for this method is the end of the dormant season just before the plant begins active growth.

With Oldenburgia grandis, some of the terminal leaves should be left on the truncheons. These may fall off before new leaves develop, but it is important to be patient because they may take a few months to establish. The basal cut of the truncheon should be treated with a fungicide and then dried out to prevent the stem from rotting. Plant the truncheon directly into the garden or into a large pot containing well-drained potting media. Water the truncheon well, but allow the media to partially dry out between watering. The success of this method of propagation varies, but if the truncheons root then one has a reasonably large plant instead of the much longer process of growing from seed. Plants grown from seed at Kirstenbosch reached 300 mm after five years growth.

Oldenburgia grandis makes a striking specimen. It is slow growing and long lived and suitable for rockeries and other warm, dry and well-drained positions in the garden. This very handsome, decorative tree can also be planted in a small garden, courtyard or in a large pot. It must be grown in a ventilated position in full sun and well-composted, sandy loam. This unusual, decorative tree is only occasionally available in limited numbers at the Annual Plant Fair.

Oldenburgia grandis needs to be grown in full sun with good ventilation in well-composted, sandy loam. This species needs to be watered moderately when in growth and kept dry in winter. In winter, the temperature needs to be maintained at a minimum of 7-10 º C.

O. grandis is propagated from seed and semi-hard cuttings in sand. Seed is difficult to germinate. This little decorative tree grows here at Kirstenbosch and is not commonly available in nurseries.",,,,,,,,

The colour of the foliage-like branches is a deep green with small brown inflorescences at the tips. The growth form of this species is quite unique in that all the branchlets are fertile, in contrast with other restios where the finely divided side stems are not fertile. The branches are slightly arching and this gives the plants a very elegant appearance. The plants can reach a height of 1 to 1.5 m in three years and with age become slightly more upright and can reach a height of 2 m after five to seven years. Male and female plants flower sporadically from September to November, the female flowers are a deep pink, whereas the male flowers are pale yellow-green.","The species name capensis refers to the fact that this plant can be found throughout the southern part of South Africa, the old Cape Province. It is part of the large family of Restionaceae, a southern hemisphere family of more than 400 species of about 40 genera in southern Africa, Australia, Madagascar, Indo-China and Chile. About 320 species occur in South Africa, most of them in the Cape Floristic Region. Rhodocoma is a relatively small genus with six described and published species, R. gigantea and R. capensis being the best known. Thamnochortus insignis is the best known restio in South Africa for its widely used, long-lasting thatching material.","This is a very widespread species and can be found along roadsides, streamsides, in little pockets of soil in between rocks, and in damp loamy soils from the Cederberg in the Western Cape all along the inland margins of the Cape Fold Mountains to Grahamstown in the Eastern Cape. Driving through the Little Karoo in a very dry and hot landscape, it is quite surprising to find a soft-looking restio like Rhodocoma capensis growing in a drainage ditch along the road, covered in red dust. It is a very hardy and tough species, and very adaptable. The plants have proved hardy in cold climates, withstanding temperatures of - 7 ºC when provided with good protection in the form of a deep layer of mulch.",,"Since its introduction into the horticultural market, Rhodocoma capensis has proved to be a popular plant for gardens and large formal plantings, with its elegant, evergreen appearance. This is the most commercially useful aspect of the species as the foliage is too soft for the traditional use as a broom, while the high tannin content of the plant makes it unpalatable for animals except for the very young growth.

Rhodocoma capensis is best grown from seed. The seed is very difficult to collect in large quantities as it is very small and is released by the plants as soon as it is ripe. By the time the seeds are ripe it is also difficult to differentiate between the male and female plants. However, the germination rate of Rhodocoma is very high, up to 80% when the seed is sown at the right time of the year and treated with smoke or a solution of smoke water. The seed should be sown in autumn or early spring when the night temperature is around 10 º C and the day temperature 15º C higher.

Division of the plants is not easy, the plants can only be divided in quite large pieces and re-growth is slow. This should be done during the cold winter months or during late winter/early spring in the northern hemisphere. Rhodocoma capensis can be planted in large groups in formal plantings, in mixed borders or in containers. The plants should be well mulched with pine bark or any other kind of rough mulch and can be fed occasionally with an organic fertilizer. They need to be watered regularly. When the plants are planted in the right place, in full sun and with plenty of air movement around them, they are very hardy and do not seem to suffer from many pests or diseases. The only pest this species seems to suffer from now and again is a small spider or mite which spins a web around a bunch of stems. If the web is not removed by hand as soon as possible, that part of the plant dies back.",,,,,,,,
Sphagnum,Sphagnum,,"Sphagnum is the only genus in the family Sphagnaceae. The plant forms clusters of short branches (heads or coma) above, and below the heads, elongated spaced out tufts (fascicles) of branches are formed along the stem. Each tuft is often made up of three to eight branches. The plant is pale green with shades of pink, red, yellow or brown. The stems are erect and individually weak and gain support by aggregation and growing in dense masses or cushions. The length of the stem is practically indefinite (Cavers 1971). It is believed that Sphagnum plants can live for thousands of years as the shoot of the plant is continually growing upwards as the plant dies back below. The leaves are differentiated: the stem leaves are small, fewer and spaced out; triangular to oblong or linear, while the branch leaves are numerous and crowded; oval or ovate to lanceolate. The adult Sphagnum lacks rhizoids and absorbs water directly through the stem and leaves.

Sphagnum is dioecious (male and female flowers borne on separate plants) or monoecious (male and female flowers borne on same plant). The male (perigonia) and the female (perichaetia) inflorescences are borne on special apical branches. The sporophyte is elevated above the perichaetial leaves. The capsule lacks a peristome. The operculum is convex. The calyptra is colourless and membranous. The spores are weakly ornamented. For moss terminology see Magill (1981).",,"There is no definite record on the conservation of Sphagnum moss in South Africa, because true bogs, in the northern sense, are not formed (Magill 1981) and there is very little peat moss in our wetlands. However, due to increased urbanisation, industrial developments and global warming challenges, SANBI is one of the major role players in ensuring conservation and sustainable use of wetlands in South Africa.

Sphagnum occurs throughout the world, with the northern hemisphere regions, e.g. Canada and North America, being the centres of dominance. It extends from the tropics and north and south temperate zones to subarctic and antarctic regions (Parihar 1965). Peat moss generally prefers very wet or damp habitats. In South Africa it grows on soil or rocks in wet, shaded forested areas, mountain seeps, stream banks, near waterfalls, small pools, open swamps, drainage lines, and seepage areas.

Peat moss grows in a humid environment where soil conditions are acidic. The presence of a colloidal substance in cell walls liberates acid. The pH of the water of Sphagnum bog may range from 3.7 to 4.9 (Parihar 1965). The acidity inhibits bacterial and fungal growth. The old, lower part of this moss does not readily die because the acidity of its environment discourages the growth of micro-organisms and it therefore decomposes slowly. This partly dead tissue eventually forms a Sphagnum mass, mixed with other plant remains. This mass is slowly compressed and hardened over the years and forms a compact dark coloured substance known as peat, hence the name peat moss (Parihar 1965). It is this compact mass from which fuel in the form of coal, may be produced.

The leaves of Sphagnum are made up of dead, relatively large inflated water-storage cells (leucocysts), generally with numerous fibrils and pores. It is these specialised cells that give this genus its unique, high water-holding capacity. Wet mass of Sphagnum can be up to 20 times its dry mass (Glime 2007). The leucocysts are surrounded by a network of living, narrow, elongated chlorophyll-containing cells (chlorocysts). The classification of the Sphagna (peat mosses) is primarily based on the structure of these two kinds of cells (Cavers 1971).

Like other mosses, Sphagnum is resistant to desiccation. The plant loses water in dry conditions, appears white and brittle, and becomes dormant but then springs back to life and looks green or tinged with colour in wet conditions.",,,,,"The varied uses of peat moss can be classified as ecological (good environmental status indicators, heavy-metal pollution monitoring and clean-up); economical (fuel as a source of coal); household (cushioning, lining, packaging and decoration); medicinal (antiseptic, antibiotic); and horticultural.

Carissa edulis,Carissa edulis,,"Carissa edulis is a much branched spiny evergreen shrub or small tree, usually multistemmed, often scrambling up to 6 m tall and forming a dense canopy. All parts of the plant release white, non-toxic, milky latex.

Young branches are green, smoothly covered with short hair, but older branches and stem become light brown and corky with deep cracks. The plant is armed with rigid spines up to 70 mm long and nearly always simple, not forked as with other species.

Leaves are simple and opposite, leathery, dark green above and paler below, with or without hair; and leaf base is shallowly lobed; margins are smooth; leaf stalk up to 5 mm long.

Flowers in terminal heads up to 40 mm in diameter, white tinged pink to purple and up to 20 mm long; corolla with lobes overlapping to the right, with a strong sweet jasmine-like scent. Flowering in spring and early summer, from September to December.

Fruits fleshy, ovoid, 6-11 mm in diameter, red to purplish black berries 2- to 4-seeded. Unripe fruits are green with red to purplish marks. Ripe fruits are dark red to purplish black.","The genus name Carissa is derived from the Indian name for plants of this genus, which contain a bitter and poisonous glucoside in the bark called carrisin. The species name edulis means 'edible', referring to the fruits.","This species is Least Concern (LC), not at risk of extinction (Raimondo et al. 2009). It does not qualify for any of the categories of threat.

It occurs in bushveld, often in riverine vegetation or on termite mounds,and common in deciduous to evergreen woodland; it is partial to granite soil.

The distribution is from Senegal and East Africa in the north to Mpumalanga and Limpopo in the south. Also in Asia to India and Thailand, and on some Indian Ocean islands.",,"It can be propagated from both seeds and cuttings. Fill a tray with river sand and place the seeds on the surface, press them into the sand until they are flush with the surface and cover with a layer of sand equal to the thickness of the seed.

Keep them in a warm spot; germination takes about 7-14 days. Seedlings can be transplanted into nursery bags filled with a mixture of soil and compost (2:1 ratio) when they reach the 2-leaf stage, or they can be planted into open ground. Seedlings and young plants are frost-tender and should be covered by grass or shade cloth for the first two winters if grown in an area affected by frost. The simple-spined num-num has a growth rate of 1-2 m per year; it is very drought resistant.",,,"Traditionally decoctions of roots are used as pain killer and to treat malaria. Taken warm and in small quantity it is also used for indigestion and for abnormal pains during pregnancy. The fruits help in the treatment of dysentery. The powdered root is used as a remedy for chest complaints. An infusion made from the roots is drunk to ease stomach ache, as a cough remedy or is dropped into the eye for cataract problems. Roots contain carissin that can be used to treat cancer. It has been successful in treating Herpes simplex virus.

Fruits are edible, the milky red pulp having a pleasant sweet taste and being much sought after. The fruit can be fermented to make a refreshing pink wine or left longer to make vinegar. Boys eat the fruits when looking after livestock in the forest.",,,,,
Melianthus major,Melianthus major,,"A fast-growing, vigorous perennial, Melianthus major grows about 2.5 m tall, suckering and spreading to about 3.5 m as it goes. The distinctive large, smooth leaves are a light bluish-green, deeply divided, with a winged rachis, toothed leaflets, a ruffled surface and a strong, unpleasant, nutty odour when touched. The leaves are placed at intervals up the thick stems. The flower spikes grow out from the tip of the stems in spring (August to September), rising up above the leaves, drawing attention with their unusual dark maroon to rusty reddish colouring. These flower spikes are racemes made up of many dark maroon flowers.On closer inspection, one can see a dark black structure in the lower part and 4 anthers and the stigma in the upper part of the flower. The showy, dark maroon flower is made up of 5 sepals, the outer envelope of the flower. The petals are very much smaller and are hidden inside the sepals. The black structure is a cup-shaped nectary, which is large and well developed and situated on the receptacle (base of the flower), which has been extended to form a mentum (like a chin), both of which are enclosed by one of the maroon sepals. The nectary produces copious quantities of black nectar. The flowers resupinate when mature, which means that they turn upside down, due to the petiole twisting through 180°. When in bud and freshly open, they have the nectary at the base of the flower and when pollinated they close again and twist around and hang upside down, with the sepal that encloses the nectary on top.The flowers are followed by pale green, 4-chambered, bladder-like pods, drying to pale brown, and containing the shiny black seeds","The genus Melianthus means ‘honey flower’, from the Greek meli, meaning ‘honey’ and anthos, ‘flower’, referring to the nectar-rich flowers. The name ‘honey flower’ was in use long before its scientific name Melianthus was published, the species was introduced to horticulture in Holland in 1673, and only named by Linnaeus in 1753. The species name major, is Latin and means ‘larger’ or ‘greater’, because this is the largest of the species. The Afrikaans common name kruidjie-roer-my-nie, which means ‘touch-me-not-herb’, refers to the unpleasant smell of the leaves when they are touched.","According to the Red List of South African plants, Melianthus major is not threatened and its wild population is stable; it is thus assessed as Least Concern (LC). Melianthus major occurs in the Western, Eastern and Northern Cape Provinces of South Africa, growing on sandstone slopes, often along streams, from the Bokkeveld Plateau in the Northern Cape, through the Western Cape and into the Eastern Cape. There are 6 species of Melianthus, all of which are found in southern Africa, in a wide range of habitats. A species sometimes seen in cultivation is Melianthus comosus, which occurs in Namibia and the western Karoo, through the Little Karoo into the Eastern Cape, and is also known as honey flower or kruidjie-roer-my-nie. The other species are: M. dregeanus (red honey flower), M. elongatus, M. pectinatus and M. villosus (maroon honey flower).",,"Melianthus major is an easy garden plant, grown worldwide for its lush, attractive foliage. It prefers a warm, well-watered, sunny position, with good drainage. Although quite tough and adaptable, it will flourish in deep, rich soil, especially if given plenty of water. Melianthus grows fast and will make a show within a few months. It is particularly attractive in spring, when in flower and sporting its new lush leaf growth, after the wet Cape winter. Make sure to give it enough room to spread. It is well suited to a position beside a water feature or pond. It looks good in a mixed border, it makes a striking accent plant and is suitable for large containers.

During the dry summers or whenever the plants are untidy, they should be cut back hard, to encourage new growth. The plants can survive in cold areas with frost, sending new shoots from the base in spring.

Melianthus major grows very easily from seed or cuttings. The seed is sown in autumn in seed trays filled with a well-drained medium and covered lightly with sand or finely milled bark. Germination is usually within a month. The young seedlings are potted up into bags or small pots and grown on until strong enough to be planted out into the garden. The cuttings can be made any time of the year depending on material available. Cuttings are made from the new shoots sprouting from the base.",,,"Please note that this plant is toxic when taken internally, treat it with caution. It is used in traditional medicine. The leaves are used to make poultices and decoctions to treat septic wounds, sores, ulcers, boils, abscesses, bruises, backache, painful feet and rheumatic joints. The roots and leaves are used to treat snakebite, or taken in very small doses as a tonic. It is also used to make a gargle for sore throats and mouth infections. Dried flowers and leaves can be used to keep insects out of cupboards.","Leaves are toxic to grazing animals, causing death in a few hours. The toxic principle remains active even in dried leaves. The roots are also poisonous.

Acmadenia macropetala,Acmadenia macropetala,,"Acmadenia macropetala is an evergreen, small shrub, growing to a height of 500mm. It forms a single stem at the base that branches freely and loosely. The lower branches display leaf scars. The lax branches are glabrous (hairless), slender and smooth. The bark is brownish-grey with noticeable leaf scars. The branchlets are slender, covered with fine hairs and keep forking at the tip.

The dark green leaves are tiny, 3-3.7mm long x 1.13-1.7mm broad. The leaves are lanceolate, fringed with very short fine hairs, opposite and dotted with glands.

Hardly ever without a flower, the bushes are covered with deep pink flowers at the tips of the stems during autumn, winter and spring. Each of the flower's five petals has a noticeable dark pink nectar guide leading to the center of the flower. The petals 7mm long x 4.7mm broad, rounded, are dotted with glands and end in a short sharp point. Flowers are borne solitary or terminally between a pair of incipient branchlets.

The fruit is a capsule with 5 chambers/carpels, 7mm long x 4.7 mm wide, covered with fine hairs between the carpels.. Each carpel contains one black shiny seed. The seed is 4mm long x 1.5mm wide. The seed ripens in November to December.","The genus name Acmadenia is derived from the Greek akme´, meaning highest point and aden, meaning glands on the anthers. This refers to the conical gland at the apex of the anther, found in some species in this genus.","Acmadenia macropetala is not protected by any South African legislation.Acmadenia macropetala grows in quartz outcrops on shale hills from Bredasdorp to Mosselbay, at an altitude of 200-500m. This species has been collected growing on a sandstone ridge on a north- facing slope.The genus consists of 33 species, which occur in the Western Cape and Eastern Cape. Other interesting species: Acmadenia obtusata forms an upright, rounded shrub with floriferous pink flowers in autumn. Best used as an accent plant in a fynbos garden or as a pot plant. Acmadenia heterophylla and Acmadenia mundiana are other cultivated species.The first species of Acmadenia to be described was described in 1781 as Diosma tetragona by Linnaeus' son.During the flower season bees, butterflies and other insects are attracted to the bush for its nectar and responsible for pollination.Buchu seed are produced in capsules from which they are expelled on ripening. This is known as ballistic dispersal. Ants collect the seed.The Rutaceae family is characterized by the presence of oil glands dotted on the leaves. When the leaves are crushed, a fragrant aroma is produced unique to each species.Acmadenia macropetala is an attractive small buchu with great horticultural potential and is not often used in gardens. It is an ideal plant for the water-wise garden or fynbos garden.",,"Acmadenia macropetala easily adapts to growing in the garden where it requires full sun and well-drained soil. It will benefit from well-prepared soil with compost and a thick layer of mulch. The plants also respond well to slow release fertilizer such as 3:1:5.

Acamdenia macroptelala is a small shrub and best used in border planting or in the front display of any garden. Planted in a pot to decorate any stoep or patio. Buchu plants occur naturally in a mixture of fynbos plants and can be used in the same way. Planted with a combination of ericas, proteas, restios, felicias, phylicas, pelargoniums and other interesting companion plants.

This species requires full sun and planted out in-groups of three or five with enough space to grow. Buchus respond to a fairly dense planting which helps to retain soil moisture. Planting is best done during autumn, winter and spring. To retain soil moisture and keep weeds to a minimum, add a layer of mulch . They require good watering in winter and moderate watering in summer. Do not allow plants to dry out, and once established, they will survive periods of drought.

Acmadenia macropetala can be propagated by sowing seed and by taking cuttings.

The seed capsules develop after flowering, seed are collected from the current year's capsules. Harvest the seed after the first capsules opened Place the capsules and seed in closed paper bag or closed container (not plastic). Store it in a warm and dry place. You can hear the seed expelled from the ripening capsule.

The optimum time for sowing is during autumn. Clean seeds and sow on a prepared medium of sand and compost in equal parts in a seed tray. Cover seeds with a thin layer of bark and water. Place seed trays in a covered area with good light and ventilation. Keep seed trays damp and germination will take place within one to two months. Seedlings are pricked out when four true leaves have developed . Take care not to damage the fine roots. Seedlings are harden-off under shade structure for 3-4 weeks before placed in the sun. The growing tips of seedlings are pinched out to encourage bushy growth. Feed buchus regularly with a balanced nutrient. The yellowing of leaves can be treated with an application of iron chelate . After 8-9 months the plants can be planted out in the garden.

Vegetative propagation (cuttings) is done from August to early October when suitable material is produced after flowering. Cuttings have the advantage of producing a larger flowering plant more rapidly than seedlings. Heel- and semi-hardwood cuttings, 50-70 mm, are taken from the current year's growth.

Prepare cuttings by making a clean cut below the node and remove a third of the foliage . Dip the base of the cuttings in a rooting hormone. Firmly place the cuttings in a medium of 50 % bark and 50 % polystyrene. Ideally these cuttings should now be placed in an well-aerated propagation unit with a bottom heat of 24° C. Ideally, rooting occurs in 9-11 weeks. Carefully pot the rooted cuttings, using a well drained, humus-rich, fynbos potting medium (2 parts leaf mould, 1 part coarse sand). Plants are kept under shade for three weeks to harden off before being placed in the sun. Plants will be ready for planting in 7-8 months.

Young buchu plants are pinched back to encourage bushy growth. Once established do not cultivate the soil around the root area.

Feed regularly with a well-balanced nutrient. Phytophtera cinnamonnii, a soil and water-borne fungus, attacks the roots of most fynbos species. High soil temperatures promote the growth of this fungus, attacking the plant's root system. It prevents the uptake of water causing plants to die. Remove infected plants and use soil mulch to reduce the soil temperature. Disturb the soil as little as possible . Treat plants with a special fungicide prior to planting out. This is a precautionary measure to control the fungus and to protect adjacent plants.",,,,,,,,
Vachellia hebeclada subsp. hebeclada,Vachellia hebeclada subsp. hebeclada,,"Its growth form can vary considerably. Over large parts of its distribution range it occurs as a prostrate, spreading, multi-stemmed shrub with dense branches near ground level or with stems rising from branching underground stems. In this form it may be no more than 1 or 2 m high, but can achieve a diameter several times its height. In appearance it is thus often reminiscent of a large, flattened cushion. In some areas it occurs as a more upright shrub or small tree 3 to 8 m high with rounded, spreading crown and drooping branches, also with a considerable horizontal spread. As a low shrub it is found in dry savanna and grassland areas and on soil ranging from Kalahari sands to sandy alluvium soils, often associated with calcrete. As a more upright shrub or tree it is usually found on more moist soils with higher clay content. It is considered to be a good indicator of calcium-rich soils. It is fairly tolerant of cold.

The bark on the main stem of the tree form is thickened, dark brown to grey and longitudinally fissured, giving the stem a striped appearance. In the prostrate form the bark on the numerous main stems is dark and fairly smooth. Young, new season's shoots appear light grey due to a dense cover of short whitish hairs, and they have a velvety feel. Older, previous season's shoots are smooth, hairless, olive green to reddish brown with light-coloured transversely elongated lenticels. Still older shoots have grey bark, peeling to reveal an orange to reddish brown colour.

The stipules are modified into hardened, spinescent spines and occur in pairs at nodes. Their size and shape vary considerably. Large spines are mostly straight with only the tips slightly recurved, while shorter spines may be strongly recurved. They are usually borne at right angles to the stem, but can be raked backward or forward.

The leaves are borne at the nodes, singly or up to 4 leaves per node. The petiole and rachis are light green, grooved on top and hairy. The leaflets are bluish green with spreading hairs on the margins. A petiolar gland, if present, is fairly large and located near the junction of the first pinna pair. There is a small raised gland at the junction of the distal 1-3 pinna pairs.

Inflorescence: globose flowering heads are borne at the nodes, either singly or in groups of up to 8 per node on both new season's and previous season's shoots. The colour of the developing buds is green prior to full bloom. The open, fully developed flowering heads have a diameter of 13-17 mm. They are scented and are pale yellow to cream. Peduncles are hairy with a length of up to 20 mm. The involucel is small and located just above the base of the peduncles.

Pods and seeds: the pods are quite large and very distinctive. They are borne at the nodes on stout stalks and stand erect. They are straight or nearly so, tapered at the base and rounded at the tip. The pods are tardily dehiscent (opening spontaneously), only splitting partially. They can contain up to 10 seeds. The seeds are reddish brown, roughly elliptic and thickened, with a size of 6-15 x 4-11 mm. With its characteristic prostrate growth form and distinctive straight spines with recurved tips it is unlikely to be confused with any other South African Vachellia or Senegalia species, especially when the large upright pods are present.","Hebeclada refers to the pubescent (hairy) branches. Vachellia refers to George Harvey Vachell (1789 – 1839), chaplain to the British East India Company in Macoa, who collected plants in China. This plant was previously called Acacia hebeclada.",This tree is widely spread in the northern provinces of South Africa,,"Seed is set freely and, being little affected by parasites, can be collected without difficulty. The thickish testa needs filing and seeds should be brought to the boil and then left to soak for some 24 hours before being sown. Seeds germinate in 5 to 8 days, a reasonable proportion germinating if the seed has aged sufficiently. In amplification, it may be pointed out that seed of subsp. hebeclada, gathered in spring and sown in mid-August gave very poor results, while with seed collected in December from the same plant and sown in that month, a fair proportion germinated",,,,"Farmers should note that under certain conditions some species of Vachellia are poisonous. The trassiebos, Vachellia hebeclada, more often a shrub than a tree, is also reported to be poisonous. In all cases the poison took the form of prussic acid.",,,,
Kniphofia species,Kniphofia species,,"Kniphofias are herbaceous perennials growing from rhizomes. Most species of Kniphofia are evergreen while a few are deciduous and sprout again in the early summer. They bear dense, erect spikes (elongated inflorescence with stalkless flowers) above the level of the leaves in either winter or summer depending on the species. The small, tubular flowers are produced in shades of red, orange, yellow and cream.

Kniphofia form large clumps of arching leaves which are long, narrow and tapering. The leaves are non-succulent, unlike the leaves of aloes. This distinguishes them from a plant such as Aloe cooperi. The leaf surface is glabrous (smooth) in all but one species, namely, K. hirsuta.

The underground part of the plant consists of a thick rhizome and fibrous, fleshy roots. In some Kniphofia species the rhizome divides forming groups of stems, while in others the stems are more or less solitary. The vast majority of Kniphofia species do not produce an aerial stem, but exceptions do occur as is the case with old specimens of K. caulescens and K. northiae which can reach a height of 30 cm.","The genus Kniphofia was named in honour of Johannes Hieronymus Kniphof, 1704-1763, who was a professor of medicine at Erfurt University in Germany.","Kniphofia spp. occur naturally in all the nine provinces of South Africa. KwaZulu-Natal possesses the highest number of Kniphofia species, compared to the other provinces with ± 40 to 50 species. Kniphofia also occurs in Lesotho, Swaziland and northward towards Sudan. The species diversity, however, decreases as one moves north. Three species occur naturally outside continental Africa. Two of these species occur in Madagascar and one in Yemen. Most Kniphofia species are found growing near rivers or in places where conditions will become damp or marshy for part of the year. A small number of species prefer dry conditions with good drainage.Kniphofia belongs to the family Asphodelaceae which comprises 17 genera (10 of which occur in South Africa) and about 750 species. About 70 species of Kniphofia occur in Africa and 47 of these are found in the eastern areas of South Africa. The genus Kniphofia is very closely related to the genus Aloe. As a result, the first Kniphofia to be described, namely K. uvaria, was mistakenly thought to be an Aloe and was thus initially named Aloe uvaria.",,"Kniphofia grow well in rich soil located in an open sunny position or partial shade. Most species require plenty of water during the growing season if they are to thrive and flower well. They should also be fertilised monthly during their active growing period. Kniphofia species are generally hardy to semi-hardy. Most species tolerate frost but the winter-flowering species should be protected. Some summer-flowering species die down in winter and grow again in the early summer. In cultivation Kniphofia resent disturbance. They will take a year to settle down after being divided and will not flower well. They should therefore be left undisturbed for many years until their flowers show signs of deterioration through overcrowding. Some commonly cultivated Kniphofia species include K. praecox, K. linearifolia, K. uvaria, K. multiflora, K. caulescens and a variety of attractive cultivars.

These plants can be propagated by seed or by division. Division will produce the quickest results since seed takes a long time to produce flowering plants. Large clumps can be lifted and divided, using a spade and then replanted.",,,,,,,,
Sewejaartjie ,Syncarpha argyropsis,,"Syncarpha argyropsis is an ornamental plant forming a dense, rounded shrublet up to about 500 mm high and 500 mm wide. The rambling branches are tightly woven into a latticework of shiny, silvery, felted stems and leaves that form a compact ball. It produces tight, silvery white buds that open to lovely, crisp, papery flowers with bright yellow centres. The buds develop from midwinter and the flowers persist from late winter until early summer (August to November). The flowers are crowded at the ends of the branches and cover the entire plant. The flower heads last for quite a few months which is why it is known as one of the everlasting group of plants.

The only collection of this species represented at Kirstenbosch is from the coast at the Skoenmakerskop Nature Reserve. The plants there were growing on sand dunes and formed large, neat, rounded shrubs. Most of the plants had silvery flowers, but a selection was made of a form with a lovely pink blush which also grows at Kirstenbosch. This selection has been called Syncarpha argyropsis `Blush'.","Syncarpha is derived from the Greek syn, meaning united, and carphos, a small dry body, possibly referring to the dry, papery floral bracts which are united into a cone-like structure. The species name means like silver, from the Greek argyros, silver and opsis, appearance.","Syncarpha argyropsis is not listed as threatened, but this might change owing to the intensive pressure for development along the southern Cape coast.

Syncarpha argyropsis is an herbaceous perennial that is restricted to the coastal zone from Rooi Els near Betty's Bay in the west to Port Elizabeth. Herbarium records show that it occurs consistently on or near the coast on tertiary limestone outcrops or dune sands. It also grows on dry sand dunes around coastal pans. Syncarpha argyropsis shows a number of adaptations typical of many plants that grow close to the sea. It grows in neutral to alkaline soils in deep sand such as on sand dunes and out of calcrete crevices. It is well adapted to the quite harsh conditions found along the southern Cape coast, which include strong salty winds, wind-blown sand, hot, sunny, and dry summers. Its adaptation to this climate includes felt-like hairiness and silvery foliage that protect it from damage and desiccation from salt-laden wind. The fine hairs on the leaves and stems keep salt particles from direct contact with the plant surfaces and trap moist air around the plant. The silvery foliage reflects the harsh, bright summer sun's rays instead of absorbing too much heat.

Syncarpha argyropsis is hardy in Cape Mediterranean conditions and an attractive addition to coastal and fynbos gardens. Its lovely shape and attractive texture and flowers make it a wonderful addition to the arsenal of any landscape gardener. This is the type of plant that will make a dramatic impression when arranged in large, sweeping plantings.",,"Syncarpha argyropsis is easily rooted from cuttings. Tip or stem cuttings root well in multi-trays on heated benches under mist spray. Cuttings are rooted in autumn or spring in a rooting medium of equal parts bark and polystyrene chips. They will also root in cold frames in coarse, well-drained sand. Soft wood or semi-hardwood rooting hormone may be used to aid the rooting process.

This species grows easily from seed sown in well-drained, sandy soil and subjected to smoke treatment. Seed is normally sown from late summer into autumn, i.e. March to May or in spring or early summer in September to November.

Syncarpha argyropsis should be planted in gardens where it is in full sunlight and is well ventilated. This species performs best when planted in rockeries on sloping ground, terraces or embankments.

This species does not require pruning as it naturally retains a lovely compact shape. Even though it grows naturally in sandy calcareous soils, it adapts well to a variety of other soil types as long as they are well drained. These include poorer acidic fynbos soils, calcareous soils and granitic soils. This species does not need large quantities of fertilizers; however, regular applications of diluted organic liquid or small amounts of organic pellet fertilizers such as Bounce Back will yield good results. Mulching with well-rotted compost once or twice a year is also recommended.",The vernacular name sewejaartjie comes from the belief that the flower heads will last for seven (sewe) years (jaar) when cut and kept in the house,,,,,,,
Leucadendron discolor,Leucadendron discolor,,"The juvenile phase of Leucadendron discolor is a small densely bushy shrub. A year or two after planting out it matures and gradually sends up long erect flowering shoots reaching an eventual height of 2 m and a spread of 1-1.5 m.
One of the distinguishing features of this Leucadendron are the grey-green broadly ovate leaves. Another, are the flowerheads which appear in spring. Male flowerheads are bright red and yellow surrounded by creamy yellow involucral leaves. Female plants form a grey-green cone surrounded by pale green involucral leaves that almost enclose the flowerhead.
Winged seeds are found inside the cone on the female plant. They ripen a few months after flowering and are retained on the plant. Discolor means two colours and refers to the flowerhead on the male plant. It is bright red in bud, changing to sunshine yellow as the pollen appears.
The Piketberg conebush is pollinated by insects carrying pollen from the male flower onto the female cone. Pollination occurs and seeds form and grow within this cone. The cone remains tightly closed protecting the seeds from the weather and from being eaten by animals.
Plants are killed by fire. After a fire all the cones open to release the seed which drops to the ground, germinates and establishes a new population.","The genus name is composed of leucos, meaning white and dendron, meaning tree. This refers to the iconic Silvertree (Leucadendron argenteum) on which the genus was based. Early Dutch settlers originally referred to the Silvertree as the Witteboom or 'White tree'.","Leucadendron discolor is listed as VU (Vulnerable) and the population is seen to be declining.

One of the threats is wild flower harvesting. Male plants are harvested for cut flowers leaving skewed population ratios of male to females. As sub-populations are small, this drastically affects pollination and seed production and therefore future generations.

Another threat is habitat loss due to expanding fruit and protea orchards. Coupled with encroaching protea orchards, is the threat of hybridization with other species of Leucadendron planted in the orchards.

The Piketberg conebush grows on rocky, sandstone soils amongst mountain fynbos at altitudes between 450 -and 500 m. As its common name alludes, it is found only in the Piketberg Mountains.

The Proteaceae family is large, consisting of about 1 400 species. The Leucadendron genus contains about 83 species; which, apart from 1 outlying species and 2 outlying subspecies, are all confined to the southern and southwestern part of the Western Cape. Leucadendron discolor has been extensively used in producing hybrid plants for use as cut flowers. It has been crossed with L. salignum, L. conicum, L. laureolum and L. gandogeri, to name a few. Special forms have also been selected: 'Pom Pom', 'Green Cup', 'Rose Cup' and 'Yellow Cup'.",,"Leucadendron discolor can be propagated from cuttings or seed. Sowing seed is the easier method and requires no specialist equipment. It also produces a more resilient and better shaped plant. Make cuttings if you have a mother plant with special features, e.g. darker red flowerheads than other plants. This is the only way to preserve these features. Cuttings tend to produce a plant with a shallower, weaker root system but if planted in a garden situation with regular watering this is not too much of a problem.

Make cuttings from December to March (summer to autumn). The cuttings should be semi-hardwood, 60-100 mm long, and taken from the current season's growth. Dip the cuttings into a rooting hormone solution or hormone powder and plant into a medium of 50% polystyrene and 50% finely milled pine bark. Place in a growing house with bottom heat (25ºC). Once the roots are well developed, remove from bottom heat and harden off for three weeks. Plant the cuttings into small bags and grow on until ready to plant into the garden.

Sow seed in April when the days are warm and the nights start to cool down (late summer to autumn). Dust the seed with a systemic fungicide. Sow on a well-drained medium, firm down and cover with a layer of sand or finely milled bark. Seed can be sown in an open seedbed, or in a seed tray placed in a sunny position. Germination begins after two to three weeks. Once two true leaves have grown, prick the seedlings out into small bags. Place the seedlings in a lightly shaded area with good air circulation. When plants are ± 50-100 mm tall, or after one year's growth, they can be planted into the garden.

Seed can also be sown directly where you want the plants to grow. Plant, cover lightly with soil and water.

The best time to place the young plants in the garden is at the start of the rainy season. This enables plants to establish themselves and send down deep roots before the hot, dry summer season. Leucadendron discolor requires a hot, sunny position with well-drained acidic soil. Add a scoop of welldecomposed compost at planting and water well for the first year.

Once members of the protea family become diseased they are very difficult to treat, and it is better to prevent disease, rather than try to cure it. Make sure your environmental conditions are correct. This includes getting direct sunlight for most of the day, a well-drained soil which does not stay saturated and will not stagnate, and good air circulation ensuring that the above-ground parts of the plant dry quickly after watering. It is also important to ensure that the soil stays cool in the hot months and that roots are not disturbed by digging. A thick layer of mulch or surrounding planting can be used to keep the soil cool and prevent moisture loss. If any of these factors are not correct, the plants become weakened and stressed, and you can be sure to attract some form of pest or disease.",,,,,,,,
Aloe mitriformis,Aloe mitriformis,,"In its natural habitat, the plants have long and creeping stems that often have secondary side shoots along their length. Instead of making upright stems, they tend to follow a sprawling habit with prostrate stems reaching up to 2 m long. These typically lie along the ground with only the terminal, leaf-bearing portion being erect.The leaves, are arranged in rosettes (circular leaf attachments), may spread erectly or curve inward. They are thick and fleshy and have a bluish-green colour. Plants that are in full sun often have more bluish leaves than those that are in shady areas which have more dark green leaves. Also, plants that are fully exposed have a tighter leaf arrangements compared to the more spaced leaves on shaded specimens. The leaf margins are armed with harmless, small white teeth, which turn yellow to dark brown as leaves become older.

A. mitriformis occurs mostly in groups and also may grow down vertical cliffs. In the latter position, plants will have thinner stems with smaller leaves to avoid breaking caused by gravitational weight. A. mitriformis is a particularly fast-growing, tough and adaptable species that easily copes with the elements.

The flowers are dull to bright red and appear in dense arrangements on the branched stalks. Up to five flowering branches may be present at one time. The shape of the racemes varies from cone-shaped to head-shaped or rounded. These aloes flower in summer from December to February.

","This aloe has been known under a number of different names recently; Aloe perfoliata, Aloe ferox and Aloe microstigma. To avoid confusion we are retaining the name Aloe mitriformis until the matter is resolved. Aloe mitriformis is so named because of the resemblance of its rosette to a mitre or bishop's cap especially in times of drought.

The genus name Aloe is derived from the Arabic, alloch, and translated as allal in Greek and Hebrew, literally meaning bitter or bitter sap which is descriptive of Aloe sap.","Aloe mitriformis is found in abundance in almost all the mountainous parts of the Western Cape. The species is probably the most typical of all the creeping aloes and is certainly not threatened.

The natural home of A. mitriformis is the Western and Northern Cape from near Genadendal in the south to the Bokkeveld Mountains near Nieuwoudtville in the north. It typically occurs in mountainous areas at altitudes of 1 200 m to 1 500 m. It prefers flat, rocky places although it is not uncommon on vertical cliff faces.

A. mitriformis has a preference for well-drained, sandy soils with a slight acidic pH and low humus level. The plants favour mild to hot summers and easily survive occasional snow in the rainy season, which is from April to July.

Plants are found characteristically among rubble-like sandstone slabs and rock, hence the other unofficial Afrikaans common name, puin aalwyn, meaning rubble aloe.A. mitriformis is one of seven aloes with distinctive creeping stems. All species of creeping aloes flower in the dry summer months and occur in the Northern, Western and Eastern Cape. It is noteworthy that five of the seven creeping aloes are threatened in one or the other way.

The genus Aloe is undergoing extensive revision with many species having been placed in new genera.",,"For smaller gardens the plants can be used in deep plant boxes or pots. The ideal garden situation is of course when they are planted in a group of ± 20 plants. For optimal flowering, remember to plant A. mitriformis in the full sun. Raised rock gardens that allow good drainage are the best situations for these plants. Embankments and retaining walls are also perfect, as the pants will naturally tend to creep and can cover large areas especially if you have a difficult or unsightly spot in the garden.

Growing A. mitriformis is very easy. The best results are achieved by simply making stem cuttings. Allow cuttings to dry for a few days and insert into river sand and keep moist. The roots appear after about two weeks.

Seeds must be sown as fresh as possible. When kept too long they are parasitized by small crawling insects. The best time for sowing would be in the winter, June to July. Use coarse river sand and cover seeds lightly, then keep moist. It is advisable to treat seeds with a long-lasting fungicide, as seedlings are prone to damping off, a fungus that eventually kills the young plants. Simply shake seeds in a container with some fungicide. After germination, when plants are about 20 to 30 mm, plant over using a sandy-loam medium and feed with organic-based fertilizer at least once a month to ensure healthy growth. If you have a garden with clay soil, use some agricultural lime and bone meal to break up and nourish the soil.

Mature plants in the garden may from time to time be subjected to attack from scale insects and aphids. For scale insects, an oil-based solution can be used, even soap water has proven effective against scale and the best results are obtained by physically removing scale using a cloth. Contact insecticides for insect usually work well but in heavy infestations a systemic application may be necessary. All known garden pests can be kept to a minimum by simply ensuring optimal growing conditions and a good selection of plants that attract wildlife to your garden.

Companion plants to A. mitriformis include A. comptonii, A. distans, A. falcata, Lampranthus multiradiatus, L. aureus and many of the Bulbine species. For groundcovers consider Gazania krebsiana, Hermannia saccifera, Lampranthus reptans Oscularia deltoides and Pelargonium myrhifolium. Larger succulents such as Tylecodon paniculatus, Cyphostemma juttea and Cotyledon orbiculata are also fantastic choices.",,,"Klipspringer ( Oreotragus aoretragus ) and dassies occasionally eat the roots and stems of the plant.

While there are no records of this particular species as a food source for humans, the yellow bitter sap in the leaves, as with other aloes, can be used as a laxative and to heal wounds.",,,,,
